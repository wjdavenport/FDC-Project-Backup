The use case for this project is to curate a dataset of publications (periodical print, book, and electronic equivalents) related to the field of consciousness.  Such a database will be useful for several reasons, including allowing an analysis of current and past research efforts, organizing the field and tracking its progress, and serving as a common point of reference for future studies.
