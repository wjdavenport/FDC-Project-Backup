38789261,Transient Attention Gates Access Consciousness: Coupling N2pc and P3 Latencies Using Dynamic Time Warping.,"The N2pc and P3 event-related potentials (ERPs), used to index selective attention and access to working memory and conscious awareness, respectively, have been important tools in cognitive sciences. Although it is likely that these two components and the underlying cognitive processes are temporally and functionally linked, such links have not yet been convincingly demonstrated. Adopting a novel methodological approach based on dynamic time warping (DTW), we provide evidence that the N2pc and P3 ERP components are temporally linked. We analyzed data from an experiment where 23 participants (16 women) monitored bilateral rapid serial streams of letters and digits in order to report a target digit indicated by a shape cue, separately for trials with correct responses and trials where a temporally proximal distractor was reported instead (distractor intrusion). DTW analyses revealed that N2pc and P3 latencies were correlated in time, both when the target or a distractor was reported. Notably, this link was weaker on distractor intrusion trials. This N2pc-P3 association is discussed with respect to the relationship between attention and access consciousness. Our results demonstrate that our novel method provides a valuable approach for assessing temporal links between two cognitive processes and their underlying modulating factors. This method allows to establish links and their modulator for any two time-series across all domains of the field (general-purpose MATLAB functions and a Python module are provided alongside this paper).",1,0.17475125698208044,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,True,0.32524874301791956
8270321,Clinical and medicolegal aspects of conscious awareness during anesthesia.,"In summary, regarding the legal aspects of awareness during anesthesia, the questions for the court to answer are: Was the patient aware? If probably yes, did the anesthesia technique cause or materially contribute to the awareness? Alternatively, if res ipsa loquitur applies, can the anesthesiologist show that the technique was not negligent, if necessary by showing that it would have been acceptable to at least a responsible minority of practitioners? It will be clear from the foregoing that good recordkeeping cannot be overemphasized. Apart from the fact that a precise and clear record tends to convince the court that they are dealing with a careful practitioner, the most important factor is that the more you have recorded about the anesthesia course, the more you will be able to tell the court about it. Finally, if you are unfortunate enough to lose and the patient is awarded damages, how much will the patient get? In the United Kingdom recently, $20,000 was awarded to patients for awareness in orthopedic and obstetric cases--perhaps a modest amount by U.S. standards. If the patient develops posttraumatic stress disorder, a much larger award is likely, especially if the patient is unable to work as a result of it; loss of earnings always increases an award, and it could easily reach $750,000 for a big earner. Insurance or other indemnity should cover this, of course, but it pays to remember one's likely exposure to risk in the event of failing to pay one's premium.",0,0.7914456342225112,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,True,0.29144563422251124

38702194,Unsupervised Characterization of Prediction Error Markers in Unisensory and Multisensory Streams Reveal the Spatiotemporal Hierarchy of Cortical Information Processing.,"Elicited upon violation of regularity in stimulus presentation, mismatch negativity (MMN) reflects the brain's ability to perform automatic comparisons between consecutive stimuli and provides an electrophysiological index of sensory error detection whereas P300 is associated with cognitive processes such as updating of the working memory. To date, there has been extensive research on the roles of MMN and P300 individually, because of their potential to be used as clinical markers of consciousness and attention, respectively. Here, we intend to explore with an unsupervised and rigorous source estimation approach, the underlying cortical generators of MMN and P300, in the context of prediction error propagation along the hierarchies of brain information processing in healthy human participants. The existing methods of characterizing the two ERPs involve only approximate estimations of their amplitudes and latencies based on specific sensors of interest. Our objective is twofold: first, we introduce a novel data-driven unsupervised approach to compute latencies and amplitude of ERP components accurately on an individual-subject basis and reconfirm earlier findings. Second, we demonstrate that in multisensory environments, MMN generators seem to reflect a significant overlap of ""modality-specific"" and ""modality-independent"" information processing while P300 generators mark a shift toward completely ""modality-independent"" processing. Advancing earlier understanding that multisensory contexts speed up early sensory processing, our study reveals that temporal facilitation extends to even the later components of prediction error processing, using EEG experiments. Such knowledge can be of value to clinical research for characterizing the key developmental stages of lifespan aging, schizophrenia, and depression.",1,0.2626238850667783,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,True,0.2373761149332217

19818891,"How can we know if patients in coma, vegetative state or minimally conscious state are conscious?","This paper examines the claim that patients in coma, vegetative state and minimally conscious state may in fact be conscious. The topic is of great importance for a number of reasons--not least ethical. As soon as we know a given creature has any experiences at all, our ethical attitude towards it changes completely. A number of recent experiments looking for signs of intact or partially intact cognitive processing in the various stages of decreased level of consciousness are reviewed. Whether or not vegetative or coma patients are in fact conscious is an empirical issue that we yet do not know how to resolve. However, the simple fact that this is an unresolved empirical issue implies that the standard behavioural assessment is not sufficient to decide what it is like to be these patients. In other words, different and more sophisticated methods are necessary. From a theoretical position, the paper moves on to discuss differences in validity between reports (e.g. verbal) and signals (e.g. brain activations) in the study of consciousness, and whether results from experiments on the contents of consciousness may be of any use in the study of levels of consciousness. Finally, an integrated approach is suggested, which does not separate research in level and content as clearly as in current practice, and which may show a path to improved paradigms to determine whether patients in coma or vegetative state are conscious.",0,0.7337591651819791,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,True,0.23375916518197914

We differentiated vaginal intercourse orgasm from noncoital orgasm. Female vaginal intercourse orgasm was further differentiated as with or without concurrent clitoral masturbation. Overall, sexual responsiveness was related to greater body awareness and lesser time and space awareness. Satisfaction, desire, and arousal were especially associated with less time awareness in women. Female orgasms during vaginal intercourse were related to greater body awareness and lesser time awareness, but noncoital orgasms were unrelated.

In Experiment 1, ERPs elicited by supraliminal stimuli were recorded when 21 participants viewed emotional facial expressions of four emotions and a neutral stimulus. Two ERP components (N2 and P3) were analyzed for their peak amplitude and latency measures. First, emotional face-specificity was observed for the negative deflection N2, whereas P3 was not affected by the content of the stimulus (emotional or neutral). A more posterior distribution of ERPs was found for N2. Moreover, a lateralization effect was revealed for negative (right lateralization) and positive (left lateralization) facial expressions.

19818912,Life can be worth living in locked-in syndrome.,"The locked-in syndrome (LIS) describes patients who are awake and conscious but severely deefferented leaving the patient in a state of almost complete immobility and loss of verbal communication. The etiology ranges from acute (e.g., brainstem stroke, which is the most frequent cause of LIS) to chronic causes (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ALS). In this article we review and present new data on the psychosocial adjustment to LIS. We refer to quality of life (QoL) and the degree of depressive symptoms as a measure of psychosocial adjustment. Various studies suggest that despite their extreme motor impairment, a significant number of LIS patients maintain a good QoL that seems unrelated to their state of physical functioning. Likewise, depression is not predicted by the physical state of the patients. A successful psychological adjustment to the disease was shown to be related to problem-oriented coping strategies, like seeking for information, and emotional coping strategies like denial--the latter may, nevertheless, vary with disease stage. Perceived social support seems to be the strongest predictor of psychosocial adjustment. QoL in LIS patients is often in the same range as in age-matched healthy individuals. Interestingly, there is evidence that significant others, like primary caregivers or spouses, rate LIS patients' QoL significantly lower than the patients themselves. With regard to depressed mood, ALS patients without symptoms focus significantly more often on internal factors that can be retained in the course of the disease contrary to patients with depressive symptoms who preferably name external factors as very important, such as health, which will degrade in the course of the disease. Typically, ALS patients with a higher degree of depressive symptoms experience significantly less ""very pleasant"" situations. The herein presented data strongly question the assumption among doctors, health-care workers, lay persons, and politicians that severe motor disability necessarily is intolerable and leads to end-of-life decisions or euthanasia. Existing evidence supports that biased clinicians provide less-aggressive medical treatment in LIS patients. Thus, psychological treatment for depression, effective strategies for coping with the disease, and support concerning the maintenance of the social network are needed to cope with the disease.

31059425,Novel Signal Processing Technique for Capture and Isolation of Blink-Related Oscillations Using a Low-Density Electrode Array for Bedside Evaluation of Consciousness.,"OBJECTIVE: Blink-related oscillations derived from electroencephalography (EEG) have recently emerged as an important measure of awareness. Combined with portable EEG hardware with low-density electrode arrays, this neural marker may crucially augment the existing bedside assessments of consciousness in unresponsive patients. Nonetheless, the close relationship between signal characteristics of the neural response of interest and blink-induced oculomotor artifacts poses particular challenges when measuring blink-related oscillations using a point-of-care platform. This study presents a novel denoising approach based on time-frequency (TF) filtering that exploits the differential temporal and spectral features to isolate the neural response from ocular artifact in a low-density array. METHODS: We investigated the effectiveness of the TF filtering technique using 64-channel EEG data collected in healthy adults, with focal analysis of the Pz and POz channels. RESULTS: TF filtering showed comparable performance in denoising the signal relative to the established gold-standard independent component analysis approach, with strong similarities in morphological characteristics as measured by intraclass correlations (p < 0.001), extent of artifact rejection based on the ocular contamination index (p < 0.006), as well as time- and frequency-domain signal capture (p < 0.05). Results are robust at the individual and group levels, and are crucially validated using raw data from only four electrodes comprising Pz, POz, Fp2, and T7. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate for the first time that TF filtering enables the successful capture and isolation of the blink-related oscillations response using a four-electrode array.

19519632,On the positive side of error processing: error-awareness positivity revisited.,"Performance errors are indexed in the brain even if they are not consciously registered, as demonstrated by the error-related negativity (ERN or Ne) event-related potential. It has recently been shown that another response-locked potential, the error positivity (Pe), follows the Ne, but only in those trials in which the participants consciously detect making the error ('Aware Errors'). In the present study we generalize these findings to an auditory task and investigate possible caveats in the interpretation of the Pe as an index of error awareness. In an auditory Go/No-Go error-awareness task (auditory EAT) participants pressed an additional 'fix error' button after noticing that they had made an error. As in visual tasks, the Ne was similar for aware ('fixed') and unaware ('unfixed') errors, while the Pe was enhanced only for Aware Errors. Within subjects, the Ne and Pe behaved in similar fashions for auditory and visual errors. A control condition confirmed that the awareness effect was not due to the requirement to report error awareness. These results reinforce the evidence in favor of the Pe as a correlate of conscious error processing, and imply that this process is not modality-specific. Nevertheless, single-trial analysis suggested that the Pe may be a delayed P3b related to stimulus processing rather than to response monitoring.",1,0.4027527449220593,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,True,0.09724725507794069

31068438,Interactions between Conscious and Subconscious Signals: Selective Attention under Feature-Based Competition Increases Neural Selectivity during Brain Adaptation.,"Efficient perception in natural environments depends on neural interactions between voluntary processes within cognitive control, such as attention, and those that are automatic and subconscious, such as brain adaptation to predictable input (also called repetition suppression). Although both attention and adaptation have been studied separately and there is considerable knowledge of the neurobiology involved in each of these processes, how attention interacts with adaptation remains equivocal. We examined how attention interacts with visual and auditory adaptation by measuring neuroimaging effects consistent with changes in either neural gain or selectivity. Male and female human participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) first while they discriminated repetition of morphed faces or voices and either directed their attention to stimulus identity or spatial location. Attention to face or voice identity, while ignoring stimulus location, solely increased the gain of respectively face- or voice-sensitive cortex. The results were strikingly different in an experiment when participants attended to voice identity versus stimulus loudness. In this case, attention to voice while ignoring sound loudness increased neural selectivity. The combined results show that how attention affects adaptation depends on the level of feature-based competition, reconciling prior conflicting observations. The findings are theoretically important and are discussed in relation to neurobiological interactions between attention and different types of predictive signals.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Adaptation to repeated environmental events is ubiquitous in the animal brain, an automatic typically subconscious, predictive signal. Cognitive influences, such as by attention, powerfully affect sensory processing and can overcome brain adaptation. However, how neural interactions occur between adaptation and attention remains controversial. We conducted fMRI experiments regulating the focus of attention during adaptation to repeated stimuli with perceptually balanced stimulus expectancy. We observed an interaction between attention and adaptation consistent with increased neural selectivity, but only under conditions of feature-based competition, challenging the notion that attention interacts with brain adaptation by only affecting response gain. This demonstrates that attention retains its full complement of mechanistic influences on sensory cortex even as it interacts with more automatic or subconscious predictive processes.",1,0.41353960000224865,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,True,0.08646039999775135

3764289,Dream self-reflectiveness as a learned cognitive skill.,"This research was directed toward the contradiction sustained by cognitive dream psychology, which on the one hand regards dreaming as higher symbolic activity and, on the other, sees its organizational and functional characteristics as derivative and/or inferior to those of waking consciousness. Study 1 evaluates the degree of self-reflective meta-cognition in dreams from different sleep stages. Subjects were 24 college students selected such that half were self-reported high-frequency dream recallers and half were low-frequency recallers. Both groups were composed equally of men and women. Greater self-reflectiveness (SR) was found in REM dreams as compared with those from stages 2 and 4, which did not differ. High-frequency recallers showed more dream SR than did low-frequency recallers. Study 2 assessed the extent to which self-reflective and lucid dreaming can be learned as a cognitive skill by varying levels of intention and attention paid to dreaming. After 3 weeks of home dream collection, results showed that four experimental groups had greater dream SR than did a baseline group. The most effective treatment was the mnemonic, wherein attention patterning schemas learned in waking resulted in more self-reflective and lucid dreaming than did either baseline or attention-control conditions. These results provide evidence that dreaming is not single-minded but variable along a self-reflective process continuum, and suggest functional and organizational levels that are consistent with the conception of dreaming as higher order cognitive activity.",1,0.42810057287418757,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,True,0.07189942712581243
28124464,Patients' experience of thirst while being conscious and mechanically ventilated in the intensive care unit.,"BACKGROUND: Because of changes in sedation strategies, more patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are conscious. Therefore, new and challenging tasks in nursing practice have emerged, which require a focus on the problems that patients experience. Thirst is one such major problem, arising because the mechanical ventilator prevents the patients from drinking when they have the urge to do so. To gain a deeper understanding of the patients' experiences and to contribute new knowledge in nursing care, this study focuses on the patients' experiences of thirst during mechanical ventilation (MV) while being conscious. AIMS: To explore patients' experience of thirst while being conscious and mechanically ventilated. DESIGN: This hermeneutic study used qualitative interviews of 12 patients. METHOD: Data were analyzed based on content analysis. Interviews were conducted between September and October 2014 in two large ICUs in Denmark. RESULT: Four themes relating to the patients' experiences of thirst during MV were identified: a paramount thirst, a different sense in the mouth, deprivation of the opportunity to quench thirst and difficulties associated with thirst. CONCLUSION: Patients associate feelings of desperation, anxiety and powerlessness with the experience of thirst. These feelings have a negative impact on their psychological well-being. A strategy in the ICU that includes no sedation for critically ill patients in need of MV introduces new demands on the nurses who must care for patients who are struggling with thirst. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study shows that despite several practical attempts to relieve thirst, it remains a paramount problem for the patients. ICU nurses need to increase their focus on issues of thirst and dry mouth, which are two closely related issues for the patients. Communication may be a way to involve the patients, recognize and draw attention to their problem.",0,0.5711495229594888,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,True,0.07114952295948884
9305415,Alertness and memory after sleep deprivation and diazepam intake.,"Benzodiazepines (BZDs) give rise to memory impairments. It has been questioned whether or not these impairments are related to the drug's sedative, alertness-reducing effects. Therefore, in this study, alertness was reduced in healthy subjects both pharmacologically (15 mg diazepam) and non-pharmacologically (24-h sleep deprivation, SD) in order to assess whether these manipulations both gave rise to memory impairments. Twelve subjects were tested using a repeated measures cross-over design. Drug administration was placebo-controlled and double-blind. A subjective alertness reduction was established after diazepam intake and even more after SD. Additionally, performance-disruptive effects were found on psychomotor tasks after both SD and liazepam intake. However, only diazepam, and not SD, impaired delayed recall of a word list and recall of paired associates. Thus a reduction in alertness, i.e. sedation, cannot fully account for BZD-induced memory impairments.",0,0.5557071411561452,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,True,0.05570714115614517
30564108,Atypical Anxiety-Related Amygdala Reactivity and Functional Connectivity in Sant Mat Meditation.,"While meditation has drawn much attention in cognitive neuroscience, the neural mechanisms underlying its emotional processing remains elusive. Sant Mat meditators were recruited, who adopt a loving-kindness mode of meditation along with a vegetarian diet and an alcohol-restricted lifestyle and novices. We assessed their State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and scanned their amygdala reactivity in response to an explicit and implicit (backward masked) perception of fearful and happy faces. In contrast with novices, meditators reported lower STAI scores. Meditators showed stronger amygdala reactivity to explicit happiness than to fear, whereas novices exhibited the opposite pattern. The amygdala reactivity was reduced in meditators regardless of implicit fear or happiness. Those who had more lifetime practice in meditation reported lower STAI and showed a weaker amygdala response to fear. Furthermore, the amygdala in meditators, relative to novices, had a stronger positive functional connectivity with the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) to explicit happiness, but a more negative connectivity with the insula and medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to explicit fear. Mediation analysis indicated the amygdala reactivity as the mediator for the linkage between meditation experience and trait anxiety. The findings demonstrate the neural correlates that underpin the beneficial effects of meditation in Sant Mat. Long-term meditation could be functionally coupled with the amygdala reactivity to explicit and implicit emotional processing, which would help reduce anxiety and potentially enhance well-being.",0,0.5481231131696234,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,True,0.048123113169623366
24775120,The Selfish Goal: autonomously operating motivational structures as the proximate cause of human judgment and behavior.,"We propose the Selfish Goal model, which holds that a person's behavior is driven by psychological processes called goals that guide his or her behavior, at times in contradictory directions. Goals can operate both consciously and unconsciously, and when activated they can trigger downstream effects on a person's information processing and behavioral possibilities that promote only the attainment of goal end-states (and not necessarily the overall interests of the individual). Hence, goals influence a person as if the goals themselves were selfish and interested only in their own completion. We argue that there is an evolutionary basis to believe that conscious goals evolved from unconscious and selfish forms of pursuit. This theoretical framework predicts the existence of unconscious goal processes capable of guiding behavior in the absence of conscious awareness and control (the automaticity principle), the ability of the most motivating or active goal to constrain a person's information processing and behavior toward successful completion of that goal (the reconfiguration principle), structural similarities between conscious and unconscious goal pursuit (the similarity principle), and goal influences that produce apparent inconsistencies or counterintuitive behaviors in a person's behavior extended over time (the inconsistency principle). Thus, we argue that a person's behaviors are indirectly selected at the goal level but expressed (and comprehended) at the individual level.",1,0.454407443893371,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,True,0.04559255610662899
8580219,Effect of state of alertness on the heart rate response to ocular compression in human infants.,"Because the state of alertness exerts a profound influence on autonomic cardiac control, we hypothesized, that the heart rate response to a vagal stimulus, i.e., ocular compression, may differ during different states of alertness. We studied 8 healthy infants with a postconceptional age of 35-41 weeks (mean +/- SD 37.9 +/- 2.1 weeks). They underwent a standardized ocular compression test during polygraphically controlled wakefulness, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM (NREM) sleep. The R-R intervals were measured (1) during the 60 s preceding the ocular compression test, to determine the mean control R-R interval, and (2) during compression. Percent R-R interval was defined as the longest R-R interval in milliseconds during the test divided by the mean control R-R interval and multiplied by 100. The longest R-R interval during the test was significantly greater in REM sleep than in wakefulness (p < 0.05) and in NREM sleep (p < 0.01):939 +/- 360, 623 +/- 355, and 538 +/- 60 ms, respectively. The percent R-R interval was significantly greater in REM sleep than in NREM sleep (p < 0.01):236 +/- 91 and 129 +/- 16, respectively. The time from the longest R-R interval to return to mean control R-R interval, i.e., vagal escape, was significantly shorter in REM sleep than in NREM sleep and in wakefulness (p < 0.01): 843 +/- 168, 2,131 +/- 712, and 2,078 +/- 913 ms, respectively.

Opioid and other prescription misuse has implications for the health and productivity of workers. Easy-to-access webinars that help employees learn about alternatives to prescription use may decrease risk. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of an interactive but brief health consciousness and prescription drug intervention for a diverse sample of employees and show effectiveness via both Internet-delivered webinar and classroom delivery. METHODS: Employees from a variety of workplaces filled out pre- and post-questionnaires upon completion of a one-hour long intervention. RESULTS: A total of 114 participants completed the pre- and post-questionnaires. Results showed that, compared with before the training, participants reported significantly more knowledge about prescription drug misuse and alternatives to prescription drug use after the training (t(113)=7.91, P<.001). Moreover, the medium of presentation (ie, face-to-face vs webinar) did not significantly impact effectiveness of the training (F(1,98)=1.15, P=.29). CONCLUSIONS: In both webinar and classroom formats, participants gained knowledge about alternatives to prescription drug use.

18485741,The trans-species core SELF: the emergence of active cultural and neuro-ecological agents through self-related processing within subcortical-cortical midline networks.,"The nature of ""the self"" has been one of the central problems in philosophy and more recently in neuroscience. This raises various questions: (i) Can we attribute a self to animals? (ii) Do animals and humans share certain aspects of their core selves, yielding a trans-species concept of self? (iii) What are the neural processes that underlie a possible trans-species concept of self? (iv) What are the developmental aspects and do they result in various levels of self-representation? Drawing on recent literature from both human and animal research, we suggest a trans-species concept of self that is based upon what has been called a ""core-self"" which can be described by self-related processing (SRP) as a specific mode of interaction between organism and environment. When we refer to specific neural networks, we will here refer to the underlying system as the ""core-SELF."" The core-SELF provides primordial neural coordinates that represent organisms as living creatures-at the lowest level this elaborates interoceptive states along with raw emotional feelings (i.e., the intentions in action of a primordial core-SELF) while higher medial cortical levels facilitate affective-cognitive integration (yielding a fully-developed nomothetic core-self). Developmentally, SRP allows stimuli from the environment to be related and linked to organismic needs, signaled and processed within core-self structures within subcorical-cortical midline structures (SCMS) that provide the foundation for epigenetic emergence of ecologically framed, higher idiographic forms of selfhood across different individuals within a species. These functions ultimately operate as a coordinated network. We postulate that core SRP operates automatically, is deeply affective, and is developmentally and epigenetically connected to sensory-motor and higher cognitive abilities. This core-self is mediated by SCMS, embedded in visceral and instinctual representations of the body that are well integrated with basic attentional, emotional and motivational functions that are apparently shared between humans, non-human mammals, and perhaps in a proto-SELF form, other vertebrates. Such a trans-species concept of organismic coherence is thoroughly biological and affective at the lowest levels of a complex neural network, and culturally and ecologically molded at higher levels of neural processing. It allows organisms to selectively adapt to and integrate with physical and social environments. Such a psychobiologically universal, but environmentally diversified, concept may promote novel trans-species studies of the core-self across mammalian species.",1,0.4844684267946544,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,True,0.015531573205345595

PARTICIPANTS: Eleven volunteers (5 women; 23.40 (SD 2.09) years; BMI: 23.24 (SD 2.19)) who lacked previous experience with LCG and cold exposure experiments. RESULTS: Despite variations in core and skin temperatures, thermal comfort, thermal sensation, and mean body temperature did not fluctuate significantly over time. Participants were able to find a desired level of LCG inlet temperature within 25 minutes which was maintained at similar levels until the 65th minute of the cold exposure. During exercise, LCG inlet water temperature decreased significantly. Regression models demonstrated that mean skin temperature and change in mean body temperature were significantly associated with thermal comfort and thermal sensation. Subsequent models revealed that, although all temperature variables were associated with LCG inlet water temperature, the coefficient of determination mainly depended on mean skin temperature and change in mean body temperature. The involvement of skin temperature was anticipated as the liquid conditioning garment was in contact with the skin. CONCLUSIONS: Humans generate conscious thermoregulatory responses in resting and exercise conditions during exposures to cold environments that are aimed towards maintaining a threshold mean body temperature, rather than temperature changes in individual body regions.",0,0.5095795851502811,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,True,0.009579585150281122

38803854,Volitional mental absorption in meditation: Toward a scientific understanding of advanced concentrative absorption meditation and the case of jhana.,"Meditation has been integral to human culture for millennia, deeply rooted in various spiritual and contemplative traditions. While the field of contemplative science has made significant steps toward understanding the effects of meditation on health and well-being, there has been little study of advanced meditative states, including those achieved through intense concentration and absorption. We refer to these types of states as advanced concentrative absorption meditation (ACAM), characterized by absorption with the meditation object leading to states of heightened attention, clarity, energy, effortlessness, and bliss. This review focuses on a type of ACAM known as jhana (ACAM-J) due to its well-documented history, systematic practice approach, recurring phenomenological themes, and growing popularity among contemplative scientists and more generally in media and society. ACAM-J encompasses eight layers of deep concentration, awareness, and internal experiences. Here, we describe the phenomenology of ACAM-J and present evidence from phenomenological and neuroscientific studies that highlight their potential applications in contemplative practices, psychological sciences, and therapeutics. We additionally propose theoretical ACAM-J frameworks grounded in current cognitive neuroscientific understanding of meditation and ancient contemplative traditions. We aim to stimulate further research on ACAM more broadly, encompassing advanced meditation including meditative development and meditative endpoints. Studying advanced meditation including ACAM, and specific practices such as ACAM-J, can potentially revolutionize our understanding of consciousness and applications for mental health.",1,0.4926818713867954,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,True,0.0073181286132045775

In the present study, we investigated the relative contribution of the alpha2-adrenoceptor vs. the imidazoline I1 receptor to the reduction in c-jun gene expression in these two brainstem areas. In conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), equihypotensive doses of three centrally acting hypotensive drugs with different selectivity for the two receptors were administered intracisternally (4 microl) to limit their actions to the brain. As a control, a similar hypotensive response was elicited by i.v. hydralazine. Clonidine (0.5 microg), or alpha-methylnorepinephrine (alpha-MNE, 4 microg), a highly selective alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist, similarly reduced c-jun mRNA expression in the NTS and rostral ventrolateral medulla. In contrast, a similar hypotensive response (-37+/-3.5 mm Hg) caused by the selective imidazoline I1 receptor agonist rilmenidine (25 microg) was associated with reduction in c-jun mRNA expression in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, but not in the NTS. Further, intra-rostral ventrolateral medulla rilmenidine (40 nmol) reduced c-Jun protein expression in rostral ventrolateral medulla and blood pressure and both responses were antagonized by selective imidazoline I1 receptor (efaroxan, 4 nmol), but not alpha2-adrenoceptor (SK&F 86466, 10 nmol) blockade. These results suggest: (1) the c-jun containing neurons in the brainstem are involved in the centrally mediated hypotension elicited by centrally acting antihypertensive agents, and (2) the alpha2-adrenoceptor modulates c-jun gene expression in the NTS and rostral ventrolateral medulla implicated in centrally mediated hypotension, and (3) the imidazoline I1 receptor mediated inhibition of c-jun gene expression in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, but not in the NTS, contributes to the centrally mediated hypotension by the second generation drugs.",0,0.0075859976978415854,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.4924140023021584

METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study (11 hospitals), we included 64 patients with confirmed COVID-19 with neurologic manifestations who underwent a brain MRI. RESULTS: The cohort included 43 men (67%) and 21 women (33%); their median age was 66 (range 20-92) years. Thirty-six (56%) brain MRIs were considered abnormal, possibly related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Ischemic strokes (27%), leptomeningeal enhancement (17%), and encephalitis (13%) were the most frequent neuroimaging findings. Confusion (53%) was the most common neurologic manifestation, followed by impaired consciousness (39%), presence of clinical signs of corticospinal tract involvement (31%), agitation (31%), and headache (16%). The profile of patients experiencing ischemic stroke was different from that of other patients with abnormal brain imaging: the former less frequently had acute respiratory distress syndrome (p = 0.006) and more frequently had corticospinal tract signs (p = 0.02). Patients with encephalitis were younger (p = 0.007), whereas agitation was more frequent for patients with leptomeningeal enhancement (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 may develop a wide range of neurologic symptoms, which can be associated with severe and fatal complications such as ischemic stroke or encephalitis. In terms of meningoencephalitis involvement, even if a direct effect of the virus cannot be excluded, the pathophysiology seems to involve an immune or inflammatory process given the presence of signs of inflammation in both CSF and neuroimaging but the lack of virus in CSF.

12883406,Propofol and sufentanil titration with the bispectral index to provide anesthesia for coronary artery surgery.,"BACKGROUND: To provide anesthesia for cardiac surgery, hypnotics and opioids are frequently titrated on variables such as mean arterial pressure and heart rate. In this study conducted in patients scheduled to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting, propofol and sufentanil, both administered by computer-controlled infusion, were titrated on the Bispectral Index (BIS) values using a predefined algorithm. METHODS: After written informed consent, 110 patients, 95 men and 15 women aged 61 (9) yr [mean (SD)], were randomly allocated to receive predicted sufentanil effect site concentrations (Ce) of 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, and 1.5 ng/ml, decreased by a third after sternotomy (groups 1-5). Target induction propofol concentration was 1.5 microg/ml and subsequently adjusted on BIS values. The following parameters were recorded: BIS values, predicted propofol Ce, the number of changes of propofol target, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, the number of bolus injection and doses of vasoconstrictor and vasodilator drugs, time to tracheal extubation, postoperative awareness and satisfaction scores, and cumulative morphine doses for the first postoperative day. RESULTS: One patient randomized to group 1 required 0.75 ng/ml sufentanil Ce instead of 0.5 ng/ml for increased BIS values on tracheal intubation. BIS values were similar in the five groups. The predicted propofol Ce values were different (P < 0.05; analysis of variance) among the five groups: 1.59 (0.47) to 1.23 (0.25) microg/ml in group 1 and group 4, respectively. Significantly fewer changes of propofol target were required in group 4 as compared to group 1. There were no differences among the five groups for mean arterial pressure, heart rate, time to tracheal extubation, awareness, satisfaction scores, and morphine requirements. CONCLUSION: These results suggest the BIS, as part of an algorithm that uses both the absolute BIS value and its increase following tracheal intubation, can be used to effectively titrate both propofol and sufentanil. A predicted sufentanil Ce of 1.25 ng/ml before and 0.8 ng/ml after sternotomy was associated with the lowest predicted propofol Ce and fewer changes of propofol target. Lower sufentanil concentrations required higher propofol concentrations and more frequent changes of the target propofol concentration and were associated with similar hemodynamic tolerance.",0,0.014539217664201859,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.48546078233579815

During their stay in hospital one third of the patients with dysphagia died, one third became normal and one third still had dysphagia when they were discharged. After one week, one, three and six months respectively, the cure rate for dysphagia was 29.4%, 4.1%, 55.9% and 55.9%, and survival 83.8%, 67.6%, 61.8% and 60.3%. Thus after 6 months only 3 patients (4.4%) were alive and dysphagic. Half of the 'cures' occurred in the first week, and none occurred after more than 77 days. As compared to the non-dysphagic patients, the dysphagic patients had 10 times more risk of respiratory infection, 18 times higher risk of death, greater loss of albumin and less loss of urea. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of dysphagia in CVA and although functional prognosis is not unfavorable, respiratory infections, malnutrition and death are frequent.",0,0.01687099806660327,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.48312900193339675

16311740,Predictors of intracranial injuries in children after blunt head trauma.,"This study was conducted to determine if clinical features can predict the risk of intracranial injury (ICI) in pediatric closed head trauma. We enrolled 3,806 children under 16 years consecutively referred for acute closed head trauma to the paediatric emergency room of five Italian children's hospitals. Relevant outcomes were death and diagnosis of ICI. Clinical symptoms and signs were evaluated as possible outcome predictors. Children were also classified into five groups according to their clinical presentation. The association of ICI with signs and symptoms and the appropriateness of the five-group classification in predicting the likelihood of ICI were evaluated by logistic regression analyses. ICI was diagnosed in 22 children; 2 of them died. The risk of fatal and nonfatal ICI was 0.5 and 5.2 per 1,000 children with closed head trauma respectively. Significant associations were found between ICI and loss of consciousness, prolonged headache, persistent drowsiness, abnormal mental status, focal neurological signs, signs of skull fracture in non-frontal areas and signs of basal skull fracture. The five-group classification of children allowed an excellent prediction in terms of likelihood of ICI (ROC area 0.972). CONCLUSIONS: Selection of children with closed head trauma based on different combinations of signs and symptoms allows for early identification of subjects at different risk for ICI. In patients with minor head injuries, the absence of loss of consciousness, drowsiness, amnesia, prolonged headache, clinical evidence of basal or non-frontal skull fracture identified 100% of children without lesions. Validation of our results with a larger sample of patients with ICI would be highly desirable.",0,0.026661223152262475,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.4733387768477375
21252705,Successful extubation in the operating room after infratentorial craniotomy: the Cleveland Clinic experience.,"BACKGROUND: There is lack of information in the literature about the rate of successful extubation after infratentorial craniotomy and the risk factors associated with failed extubation. This retrospective analysis assessed the rate of successful extubation after infratentorial craniotomy in a tertiary hospital. METHODS: Only infratentorial craniotomies for tumors, vascular malformations in the brainstem or cerebellum, and fourth ventricle cysts performed in prone position were included. Failed extubation was defined as the need for airway reintubation in the operating room (OR), postanesthesia care unit, or intensive care unit after surgery. Only those patients, in whom the primary reason for reintubation was respiratory failure, deteriorating level of consciousness, or inability to protect the airway were included in the statistical analysis. Prolonged intubation was defined as airway intubation longer than 48 hours from the initial intubation. RESULTS: This is a retrospective study that included perioperative information from 145 adult patients. One hundred and twenty patients (82%) were primarily extubated in the OR and the rest remained intubated (18%). From the latter group, 9 (36%) and 16 (64%) were extubated in the postanesthesia care unit or intensive care unit, respectively. The rate of failed extubation within 24 hours after primary extubation in the OR was 0.83%. Patients not extubated in the OR had a statistically significant higher American Society of Anesthesiologists score, a longer length of surgery, a larger blood loss, and a longer stay in the hospital compared with those who were extubated in the OR. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that primary extubation in the OR after infratentorial craniotomy is feasible. However, cautions should be taken in patients with poor physical status undergoing vascular surgery and long procedures with potential significant fluid shifts.",0,0.027262655825265648,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.47273734417473434
32738878,Supine versus semi-Fowler's positions for tracheal extubation in abdominal surgery-a randomized clinical trial.,"BACKGROUND: Tracheal extubation is commonly performed in the supine position. However, in patients undergoing abdominal surgery, the supine position increases abdominal wall tension, especially during coughing and deep breathing, which may aggravate pain and lead to abdominal wound dehiscence. The semi-Fowler's position may reduce abdominal wall tension, but its safety and comfort in tracheal extubation have not been reported. We aimed to evaluate the safety and comfort of different extubation positions in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. METHODS: We enrolled 141 patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists grade of I-III who underwent abdominal surgery. All patients were anesthetized with propofol, fentanyl, cisatracurium, and sevoflurane. After surgery, all patients were transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Patients were then randomly put into the semi-Fowler's (n = 70) or supine (n = 71) position while 100% oxygen was administered. The endotracheal tube was removed after the patients opened their eyes and regained consciousness. Vital signs, coughing, and pain and comfort scores before and/or after extubation were recorded until the patients left the PACU. RESULTS: In comparison with the supine position, the semi-Fowler's position significantly decreased the wound pain scores at all intervals after extubation (3.51 +/- 2.50 vs. 4.58 +/- 2.26, 2.23 +/- 1.68 vs. 3.11 +/- 2.00, 1.81 +/- 1.32 vs. 2.59 +/- 1.88, P = 0.009, 0.005 and 0.005, respectively), reduced severe coughing (8[11.43%] vs. 21[29.58%], P = 0.008) and bucking after extubation (3[4.29%] vs. 18[25.35%], P < 0.001), and improved the comfort scores 5 min after extubation (6.11 +/- 2.30 vs. 5.17 +/- 1.78, P = 0.007) and when leaving from post-anesthesia care unit (7.17 +/- 2.27 vs. 6.44 +/- 1.79, P = 0.034). The incidences of vomiting, emergence agitation, and respiratory complications were of no significant difference. CONCLUSION: Tracheal extubation in the semi-Fowler's position is associated with less coughing, sputum suction, and pain, and more comfort, without specific adverse effects when compared to the conventional supine position.

19411525,Flumazenil reversal of sublingual triazolam: a randomized controlled clinical trial.,"BACKGROUND: Incremental sublingual (SL) dosing of triazolam has emerged as a popular sedation technique. Nevertheless, few studies have evaluated the technique's safety or efficacy. Given its popularity, an easily administered rescue strategy is needed. METHODS: The authors conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial to investigate how intraoral submucosal flumazenil (0.2 milligram) attenuates central nervous system depression produced by incremental SL dosing of triazolam (three doses of 0.25 mg across 90 minutes) in 14 adults. The authors assessed outcomes by using the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale, bispectral index (BIS) and physiological monitoring. RESULTS: The OAA/S and BIS scores increased after the flumazenil injection at the 30-minute observation point, but they were not sustained. Six hours after the initial dose of triazolam had been administered (four hours after the flumazenil or placebo challenge), all patients could be discharged from the dental clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Deep sedation from incremental SL dosing of triazolam is incompletely reversed by a single intraoral injection of flumazenil. The reversal did not persist. The authors discharged the patients from the dental clinic at 360 minutes. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: A single intraoral injection of flumazenil (0.2 mg) cannot immediately reverse oversedation with triazolam. A higher dose might be effective. Reversal for the purpose of discharging the patient early is neither appropriate nor safe.",0,0.028495477088510746,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.47150452291148925
22748466,Hypothermia caused by slow and limited-volume fluid resuscitation decreases organ damage by hemorrhagic shock.,"BACKGROUND: Hypothermia frequently occurs during fluid resuscitation of trauma victims, especially in patients with a major blood loss. Recent studies have suggested that mild hypothermia may ameliorate hemorrhagic shock (HS) induced splanchnic damage. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to compare the status of body temperature and splanchnic injury under different resuscitation speeds for HS in conscious rats. METHODS: Experimental study in an animal model of HS. Twenty-four male Wistar-Kyoto rats were used in the study. To mimic HS, 40% of the total blood volume was withdrawn. Fluid resuscitation was given 30 min after blood withdrawal. The rats were randomly divided into three groups; the control group, the 10-min rapid group, and the 12-h slow group. RESULTS: Levels of blood biochemical parameters, including aspartate transferase (GOT), and alanine transferase (GPT), were measured. Levels of serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were measured and levels of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) TNF-alpha and nitric oxide (NO) were measured by ELISA. The lung, liver and small intestine were examined for pathological changes 48 h after HS. CONCLUSIONS: Initially slow rate resuscitation with limited-volume significantly decreased body temperature, serum GOT, GPT, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 levels, levels of TNF-alpha, and NO in BALF. Moreover, the slow group had lower injury scores in the lung, liver and small intestine than the rapid group after HS. This finding suggests that mild hypothermia induced by a slow fluid resuscitation rate with limited-volume ameliorates HS-induced splanchnic damage in conscious rats.",0,0.03361563993994779,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.46638436006005224
38715471,Evaluation of the effect of Modafinil in the improvement of the level of consciousness in patients with COVID-19 encephalopathy: A randomized controlled trial.,"AIM: COVID-19 can lead to encephalopathy and loss of consciousness. This double-blinded randomized clinical trial conducted in Tehran, Iran, aimed to assess the potential effectiveness of modafinil in patients with COVID-19-related encephalopathy. METHODS: Nineteen non-intubated COVID-19 patients with encephalopathy were randomized into two groups: a treatment group receiving crushed modafinil tablets and a placebo group receiving starch powder. Modafinil was administered at a dose of 100 mg every 2 h, reaching a peak dosage of 400 mg. The level of consciousness was assessed using the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) at multiple time points on the day of medication administration. The trial was registered under IRCT20170903036041N3 on 23/5/2021. RESULTS: The average age in the modafinil and placebo groups was 75.33 and 70 years, respectively. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of chronic conditions, clinical symptoms, or laboratory data. GCS scores were similar between the groups at baseline (p-value = 0.699). After four doses of modafinil, GCS scores were slightly higher in the treatment group, but this difference was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.581). GCS scores after each round of drug administration didn't significantly differ between the treatment and placebo groups (p-value = 0.908). CONCLUSION: Modafinil exhibited a slight improvement in the level of consciousness among COVID-19 patients with encephalopathy, although this improvement did not reach statistical significance when compared to the control group. Further research with larger sample sizes and longer treatment durations is recommended to explore modafinil's potential benefits in managing altered consciousness in COVID-19 patients.",0,0.035907323722717176,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.46409267627728285
17640936,Intravenous hypertonic NaCl acts via cerebral sodium-sensitive and angiotensinergic mechanisms to improve cardiac function in haemorrhaged conscious sheep.,"Acute NaCl loading as resuscitation in haemorrhagic hypovolaemia is known to induce rapid cardiovascular recovery. Besides an osmotically induced increase in plasma volume the physiological mechanisms of action are unknown. We hypothesized that a CNS mechanism, elicited by increased periventricular [Na(+)] and mediated by angiotensin II type 1 receptors (AT(1)), is obligatory for the full effect of hypertonic NaCl. To test this we investigated the cardiovascular responses to haemorrhage and subsequent hypertonic NaCl infusion (7.5% NaCl, 4 ml (kg BW)(-1)) in six conscious sheep subjected to intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; control), mannitol solution (Man; 75 mmol l(-1) [Na(+)], total osmolality 295 mosmol kg(-1)) or losartan (Los; 1 mg ml(-1), AT(1) receptor antagonist) at three different occasions. Man normalized (144 +/- 6 mmol l(-1), mean +/- s.d.) the increase in i.c.v. [Na(+)] seen after aCSF (161 +/- 2 mmol l(-1)). Compared with control, both Man and Los significantly (P < 0.05) attenuated the improvement in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), cardiac index and mesenteric blood flow (SMBF) in response to intravenous hypertonic NaCl: MAP, rapid response +45 mmHg versus +38 mmHg (Man) and +35 mmHg (Los); after 180 min, +32 mmHg versus +21 mmHg (Man) and +19 mmHg (Los); cardiac index after 180 min, +1.9 l min(-1) (m(2))(-1) versus +0.9 l min(-1) (m(2))(-1) (Man) and +0.9 l min(-1) (m(2))(-1) (Los); SMBF rapid response, +981 ml min(-1) versus +719 ml min(-1) (Man) and +744 ml min(-1) (Los); after 180 min, +602 ml min(-1) versus +372 ml min(-1) (Man) and +314 ml min(-1) (Los). The results suggest that increased periventricular [Na(+)] and cerebral AT(1) receptors contribute, together with plasma volume expansion, to improve systemic haemodynamics after treatment with hypertonic NaCl in haemorrhagic hypovolaemia.",0,0.036138595775152216,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.4638614042248478

The primary objective of this study was to compare the effects of propofol in the lipid formulation with those of the new cyclodextrin formulation, particularly with regard to pain on injection. We hypothesized that the propofol in cyclodextrin would be associated with less pain on injection than propofol in lipid. METHODS: The study was a single-center, double-blind, 2-period, randomized, dose-escalating study using a completely balanced cross-over design in healthy volunteers. Pain on injection was compared between propofol in cyclodextrin and propofol in lipid using subject and observer assessments of pain rated at several different time points. Five response variables to pain were analyzed. RESULTS: Propofol in cyclodextrin had significantly higher pain scores for all 5 variables. Other endpoints, including sedation, showed no difference.

One-third of all patients attending between 9 pm and midnight, and almost two-thirds of patients attending between midnight and 3 am had positive breath tests. Positive breath tests were most likely in males, patients with head injuries, with overdoses, in victims of assault and in patients with a depressed conscious level, irrespective of cause. Clinical estimation of intoxication by alcohol may be accurate in the co-operative patient, but in the patient with a head injury or with a depressed conscious level from another cause, this is more difficult.

17667563,Differential dynamic of action on cortical and subcortical structures of anesthetic agents during induction of anesthesia.,"BACKGROUND: Dynamic action of anesthetic agents was compared at cortical and subcortical levels during induction of anesthesia. Unconsciousness involved the cortical brain but suppression of movement in response to noxious stimuli was mediated through subcortical structures. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with Parkinson disease, previously implanted with a deep-brain stimulation electrode, were enrolled during the implantation of the definitive pulse generator. During induction of anesthesia with propofol (n = 13) or sevoflurane (n = 12) alone, cortical (EEG) and subcortical (ESCoG) electrogenesis were obtained, respectively, from a frontal montage (F3-C3) and through the deep-brain electrode (p0-p3). In EEG and ESCoG spectral analysis, spectral edge (90%) frequency, median power frequency, and nonlinear analysis dimensional activation calculations were determined. RESULTS: Sevoflurane and propofol decreased EEG and ESCoG activity in a dose-related fashion. EEG values decreased dramatically at loss of consciousness, whereas there was little change in ESCoG values. Quantitative parameters derived from EEG but not from ESCoG were able to predict consciousness versus unconsciousness. Conversely, quantitative parameters derived from ESCoG but not from EEG were able to predict movement in response to laryngoscopy. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that in humans, unconsciousness mainly involves the cortical brain, but that suppression of movement in response to noxious stimuli is mediated through the effect of anesthetic agents on subcortical structures.",0,0.04171189975653353,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.45828810024346645

Our primary aim was to assess the potential contribution of resting-state-functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) in predicting neurological outcome. RS-fMRI was used to evaluate functional and effective connectivity within the default mode network in a cohort of 90 comatose patients and their impact on functional neurological outcome after 3 months. The RS-fMRI processing protocol comprises the evaluation of functional and effective connectivity within the default mode network. Seed-to-voxel and ROI-to-ROI feature analysis was performed as starting point for a supervised machine-learning approach. Classification of the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1-3 (good to acceptable outcome) versus CPC 4-5 (adverse outcome) achieved a positive predictive value of 91.7%, sensitivity of 90.2%, and accuracy of 87.8%. A direct link to the level of consciousness and outcome after 3 months was identified for measures of segregation in the precuneus, in medial and right frontal regions. Thalamic connectivity appeared significantly reduced in patients without conscious response. Decreased within-network connectivity in the default mode network and within cortico-thalamic circuits correlated with clinical outcome after 3 months.

11705774,Comparative actions of adrenomedullin and nitroprusside: interactions with ANG II and norepinephrine.,"The role of adrenomedullin (ADM) in volume and pressure homeostasis remains undefined. Accordingly, we compared the biological responses to infusions of ADM and nitroprusside (NP; matched for reduction of arterial pressure) and assessed their effects on responses to ANG II and norepinephrine in eight conscious sheep. During matched falls in arterial pressure (8-10 mmHg, both P < 0.001) ADM and NP induced similar increases in heart rate. ADM increased cardiac output (P < 0.001), and the fall in calculated peripheral resistance was greater with ADM than NP (P = 0.013). ADM infusions raised plasma ADM levels (P < 0.001), plasma renin activity (P = 0.001), and ANG II (P < 0.001) but tended to blunt any concurrent rise in aldosterone compared with NP (P = 0.056). ADM maintained both urine flow (P < 0.001) and sodium excretion (P = 0.01) compared with falls observed with NP. ADM attenuated the vasopressor actions of exogenous ANG II (P = 0.006) but not norepinephrine. In addition, ADM antagonized the ANG II-induced rise in plasma aldosterone (P < 0.001). In conclusion, ADM induces a different spectrum of hemodynamic, renal, and endocrine actions to NP.

This study aimed to investigate 12-month and 7-day prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms among workers of the pulp and paper industry, and assess the contribution of age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and physical activity (PA). Methods. The sample comprised 904 workers. Musculoskeletal symptoms were assessed using the Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire. chi(2) tests assessed the association between musculoskeletal symptoms and age/gender/BMI/PA, and multivariate logistic regression models predicted the 12-month occurrence of symptoms in the five most prevalent regions. Results. The five most affected body regions were the lower back, shoulders, neck, knees and wrists/hands. Older workers presented more symptoms in all body regions, except dorsal; female gender was associated with neck symptoms (p = 0.001); overweight was associated with a higher prevalence of lower back (p = 0.01), knee (p = 0.017) and ankle/foot (p = 0.037) symptoms; and a moderate PA level was associated with thigh/hip symptoms (p = 0.006).

24563440,"The relationship between blood lactate, carboxy-hemoglobin and clinical status in CO poisoning.","AIM: We aimed to determine the relationship between blood lactate, carboxy-hemoglobin (COHb) levels and the severity of clinical findings in patients with CO poisoning. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients over 18 years old and of both gender who were admitted to Emergency Department with the diagnosis of CO poisoning between 10.02.2008 and 17.03.2011 were enrolled in this study. Detailed physical examination of each patient was performed, patients and their relatives were informed about the study and written consents were noted. The levels of consciousness, physical examination findings, electrocardiographic findings, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, laboratory results (lactate, COHb, CK-MB, Troponin-I levels) and applied treatments [normobaric oxygen therapy (NBOT), hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)] were recorded to standart data entry form for each patient. ""SPSS for Windows version 18"" package program was used for statistical analysis of the data. RESULTS: Total 201 patients were included in this study. Thirty five patients (17.4%) received HBOT and lactate; COHb, CKMB, Troponin-I levels of this group were higher than the other patients. Lactate and COHb levels were statistically significantly higher in patients with GCS < 15 than the ones with GCS = 15 (p < 0.01). The patients whose both Troponin-I and CK-MB levels increased have higher lactate levels (p = 0.038), but COHb levels of these patients did not change (p = 0.495). CONCLUSIONS: According to our study, blood lactate and COHb levels were both correlated with the changes of consciousness in CO poisoning. Blood lactate levels together with COHb in defining indications for HBO treatment might be suggested.",0,0.05984796765237838,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.4401520323476216
12370116,GH and IGF-I regulate the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in cardiovascular tissues of hypophysectomized female rats.,"OBJECTIVE: This study explored whether short-term replacement therapy with growth hormone (GH) affects blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression in cardiovascular tissues in hypophysectomized (Hx) female rats. DESIGN AND METHODS: BP, HR and the expression of eNOS in the aorta, caval vein and heart were studied in Hx female rats and in Hx female rats that underwent 7 days treatment with GH and thyroxine+glucocorticoids ([T(4)+GC]). Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) was included in a second experimental protocol to explore the indirect effect of GH. The expression and localisation of eNOS was analysed by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Decreased BP (Hx 98+/-1, Intact 129+/-3 mmHg, P<0.05), HR (Hx 297+/-14, Intact 399+/-31 beats/min, P<0.05) and unchanged eNOS expression was demonstrated in Hx compared with intact rats. None of the hormones affected BP, but both GH and IGF-I increased HR compared with Hx rats (GH 358+/-10, IGF-I 337+/-7, Hx 306+/-11 beats/min, P<0.05). Replacement of GH, GH+[T(4)+GC] and IGF-I resulted in an increased aortic eNOS expression (GH 161+/-24, GH+[T(4)+GC] 177+/-25, IGF-I 153+/-21, Hx 109+/-7%, P<0.05), whereas in caval vein only GH+[T(4)+GC] affected eNOS expression. None of the hormones changed the level of eNOS in the heart. eNOS was localised in the intima layer of the aorta, whereas in the caval vein eNOS was localised in all cell layers. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the suggested positive role of GH in the regulation of the cardiovascular homeostasis. The observed up-regulation of eNOS, and presumably an increased NO bioavailability, may result in improved endothelial and cardiovascular function.",0,0.060206715178433824,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.43979328482156615

32928149,Electrocardiographic findings of methanol toxicity: a cross-sectional study of 356 cases in Iran.,"BACKGROUND: Methanol is widely used in industry; however, methanol poisoning is not common. In this regard, a number of outbreaks have been recently reported due to inappropriate processing of alcoholic beverages. Shiraz, a city located in the southern part of Iran, faced one of such outbreaks in 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic. There is no sufficient literature on the electrocardiographic findings in methanol toxicity. This study aimed to address this gap in the literature. METHOD: A total of 356 cases with methanol toxicity referred to Shiraz University of Medical Science Tertiary Hospitals (Faghihi and Namazi) in March and April, 2020. The clinical findings of blindness and impaired level of consciousness, lab data such as arterial blood gas, electrolytes, and creatinine, and the most common findings from ECGs were collected. RESULTS: The most common ECG findings were J point elevation (68.8%), presence of U wave (59.2%), QTc prolongation (53.2% in males and 28.6% in females), and fragmented QRS (33.7%). An outstanding finding in this study was the presence of myocardial infarction in 5.3% of the cases. This finding, to the best of our knowledge, has only been reported in a few case reports. Brugada pattern (8.1%) and Osborn wave (3.7%) were the other interesting findings. In multivariate analysis, when confounding factors were adjusted, myocardial infarction, atrioventricular conduction disturbances, sinus tachycardia, and the prolonged QTC > 500 msecond were four independent factors correlated with methanol toxicity severity measured with arterial blood PH on arterial blood gas measurements, with odds ratios of 12.82, 4.46, 2.32 and 3.15 (P < 0.05 for all), respectively. CONCLUSION: Electrocardiographic variations during methanol intoxication are remarkable and well-correlated with poisoning severity. Myocardial infarction was an egregious and yet a common concerning finding in this sample, which need to be ruled out in methanol toxicity.",0,0.0668090154277205,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.4331909845722795
2309537,Effects of thoracic epidural anaesthesia on central haemodynamics compared to cardiac beta adrenoceptor blockade in conscious rats with acute myocardial infarction.,"The study aimed to compare the effects of thoracic epidural anaesthesia (TEA) with those of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker, metoprolol, on central haemodynamics in conscious rats with acute myocardial infarction. During methohexital anaesthesia, appropriate vascular catheters were inserted, a thoracic epidural catheter was implanted and the left coronary artery was ligated. A recovery period of 1-2 h elapsed after termination of surgery and anaesthesia. Experiments were performed on four separate groups of animals (A-D). In Group A (n = 10) mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and cardiac output (CO) were measured, and stroke volume (SV) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were calculated before and 10-15 min after the induction of TEA (bupivacaine 5 mg.ml-1). In Group B (n = 6) left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and maximal dP/dt were recorded as in Group A. In Group C (n = 10) central haemodynamics were measured 10 min after i.v. metoprolol (0.5 mg.kg-1) and again 10-15 min after the addition of TEA. In Group D (n = 6) LVEDP and max dP/dt were measured as in Group C. The reduction in CO, SV, HR and max dP/dt was of the same magnitude with TEA and metoprolol. TEA lowered MAP by 17%, while metoprolol did not change MAP. Metoprolol caused an increase in LVEDP from 20.8 +/- 1.8 to 27.5 +/- 2.7 mmHg (2.8 +/- 0.2 to 3.7 +/- 0.4 kPa) (P less than 0.01), while TEA induced a decrease in LVEDP from 24.2 +/- 1.4 to 17.8 +/- 1.6 mmHg (3.2 +/- 0.2 to 2.4 +/- 0.2 kPa) (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0.06804229583938651,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.4319577041606135

RESULTS: The analyses were conducted on the epidemiological, clinical and prognostic aspects of the cases. The mean age of the patients (73 men and 39 women) was 26 years. The primary mode of infection ranged from cranial injuries (25%) to meningitis (17.9%) and sinusitis (15.2%). Bacteria were isolated from 16.1% cases; staphylococci and streptococci were the most frequent bacteria identified. The main clinical symptoms were motor deficit (75.9%), fever (74.1%) and headache (66.1%). Diagnosis was performed by CT scan in all cases. Fifty-three patients were treated using antibiotics alone; this medical treatment was completed by surgery in 59 cases. The results showed that 37.5% of the patients in fact fully recovered while some sequelae were identified in 49.1%. The mortality rate was 13.4%. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Consciousness disorders were in most cases responsible for the patient's death. Moreover multiple and/or voluminous abscesses were factors of the poor functional prognosis.

7784760,Syncope in athletes.,"Syncope is a brief sudden loss of consciousness and muscle tone secondary to cerebral ischaemia, inadequate oxygen or glucose delivery to the brain. The causes of syncope may be benign and require very little in the way of evaluation or treatment. However, syncope may be the harbinger of sudden death, and extensive evaluation, monitoring and detailed recommendations regarding advisability of participating in sports should be reviewed with the patient. The history is the most important clue when attempting to identify which patient with syncope is at risk for sudden death. A careful cardiac and neurological examination should be performed in any patient presenting with syncope. Selective use of laboratory testing and cardiac monitoring may assist the practitioner in making the diagnosis. Most often patients with syncope will have a benign cause such as vaso-vagal events, hyperventilation or orthostatic hypotension. Patients with a cardiac condition causing their syncope are at increased risk for sudden death. The ominous, cardiac-related causes of syncope in the younger population include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aberrant coronary arteries and aortic dissection secondary to Marfan's syndrome. In the older athletic population, coronary atherosclerosis may present with syncope. Dysrhythmias may be the cause of syncope in both populations.",0,0.0715271180170577,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.4284728819829423
10494745,"Frequency characteristics of blood pressure oscillations evoked by sympathetic transmitters, noradrenaline and adenosine triphosphate.","Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was recorded beat-to-beat in chronically instrumented, conscious, unrestrained rats under control conditions and after pharmacological inhibition of vascular sympathetic influences by means of: (1) ganglion blockade with chlorisondamine; (2) alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine; (3) P2 receptor blockade with pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS). Angiotensin II was continuously infused to prevent drastic MAP decrease during chlorisondamine and phentolamine administration. Overall MAP variability increased after ganglion blockade and combined blockade of adreno- and purinoceptors. It increased also after inhibition of purinergic influences, but was not significantly changed after vascular adrenergic blockade. Spectral analysis of spontaneous MAP fluctuations in intact rats revealed a peak centered at 0.4-0.5 Hz. Ganglion blockade suppressed MAP fluctuations with frequencies from 0.1 to 0.8 Hz. After blockade of alpha-adrenoceptors, MAP spectral density was suppressed only within the 0.1-0.45-Hz band, but increased in the 0.45-0.8-Hz band. In the latter case, sympathetically-induced peak of MAP spectrum was centered on 0.6 Hz, being evoked, presumably, by adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Blockade of P2 receptors by PPADS enhanced MAP fluctuations in the 0.1-0.45-Hz frequency band, i.e. the noradrenaline-induced peak was centered on 0.2 Hz. No peaks were observed in the 0.1-0.8-Hz frequency band during combined blockade of adreno- and purinoceptors. The present study supports the concept that sympathetic purinergic co-transmission is essential for stabilization of MAP level.

39581828,Tardive seizure after electroconvulsive therapy: Prevalence and associated factors.,"INTRODUCTION: Tardive seizure refers to a spontaneous seizure, which occurs after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). It is a rare and poorly understood phenomenon that can lead to other serious consequences such as status epilepticus. Risk factors may be associated, and its management is by no means consensual. However, tardive seizure remains little explored in the absence of feedback and data sharing. The purpose of this study was to report the prevalence of late-onset seizures following ECT during the acute phase of treatment at the stimulation unit of Razi Hospital during its seven years of activity and to identify variables associated with this adverse event. METHODS: This is a descriptive and retrospective study that was carried out at the ECT unit of Razi Hospital, Tunisia, based on the medical records of patients treated with ECT between December 2015 and September 2023. Every recorded ECT session during the initial course of treatment with available EEG tracings was included in the study. Maintenance ECT sessions, undocumented sessions, those without clinical observations, and/or those without EEG tracings were all excluded. A tardive seizure was retained according to criteria that included both recorded motor manifestations such as ""motor jerks"" or ""generalized tonic-clonic seizures"" which began spontaneously after ECT and the resumption of a state of consciousness concurrent with an equivocal EEG tracing. RESULTS: A total of 162 patients received at least one course of ECT during the research period. Ultimately, we included 1931 well documented sessions that were completed for 157 patients in all. Of the 157 patients, seven had experienced at least one late seizure after receiving ECT, accounting for 4.45% of patients. Among the 1931 sessions, 11 late seizures were noted. The prevalence of tardive seizures in our series was 0.57%. Several factors have been associated to the onset of a tardive seizure, including being a male, the presence of a neurological lesion, treatment that lowers the epileptogenic threshold, anesthesia with etomidate, stimulation charge near seizure threshold or maximum electrical load, prolonged induced seizure, and poor post-ictal suppression on the induced seizure tracing. CONCLUSION: Despite the dearth of information, tardive seizure following ECT is considered to be a rare event. Risk factor management would be the first action to be taken to prevent such an event.",0,0.07474578620742563,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.4252542137925744
1684818,Cardiovascular effects of adenosine A2 agonists in the conscious spontaneously hypertensive rat: a comparative study of three structurally distinct ligands.,"The hemodynamic responses to 5'-N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine (NECA), a nonselective adenosine agonist, were compared to those elicited by the sodium salt of 2-[p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamido adenosine (CGS 21680C) and N6-2-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(2-methylphenyl)-ethyl adenosine (CGS 24012), two structurally dissimilar selective A2 agonists in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Dose-related reductions in mean arterial pressure occurred after bolus administration of NECA, CGS 21680C and CGS 24012. Dose-dependent tachycardia was seen with both CGS 21680C and CGS 24012, whereas NECA produced a biphasic response on heart rate. At high doses (3 and 10 micrograms/kg), NECA evoked an immediate and dramatic fall in heart rate, followed by a more gradual and long-lasting tachycardia. At equihypotensive doses, both CGS 21680C and CGS 24012 produced significant increases in cardiac output, but NECA had no effect. Although each of the adenosine agonists reduced total peripheral resistance, the greatest change was produced by CGS 21680C. Hindquarter, renal and mesenteric vascular resistances were significantly reduced by both CGS 21680C and CGS 24012, whereas only mesenteric vascular resistance was reduced with NECA. CGS 24012 reduced renal vascular resistance to the greatest extent and produced a concomitant significant increase in renal blood flow. Marked elevation in plasma renin activity occurred with CGS 24012 and CGS 21680C, whereas no change was seen after NECA. The hemodynamic responses to NECA, CGS 21680C and CGS 24012 were significantly reduced by the adenosine antagonist, 8-(p-sulfophenyl) theophylline, suggesting that these agents act through stimulation of adenosine receptors in the conscious SHR. Furthermore, blockade of the beta adrenergic receptor with metoprolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly attenuated the increase in heart rate produced by NECA, CGS 21680C and CGS 24012. The cardiovascular pattern of responses to the two selective A2 agonists, CGS 21680C and CGS 24012, are distinct from those of NECA, the nonselective adenosine agonist. The responses to both CGS 21680C and CGS 24012 indicate that systemic vasodilation, with resultant cardioexcitation and stimulation of renin release, are the predominant hemodynamic effects of selective A2 agonists in the conscious SHR. In contrast, the cardiovascular effects produced by NECA are mediated by activation of both A1 and A2 receptors.",0,0.07666323183578212,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.4233367681642179

We report here an HD patient, an 82-year-old woman, who developed acute encephalopathy due to thiamine deficiency with hyperammonemia. She was admitted to Nishikawa Town Hospital due to pneumonia and was treated with ABPC/SBT for one week. While she was cured of pneumonia, she had a persistently poor appetite. On the twenty-fourth day after admission, HD with intradialytic parenteral nutrition(IDPN), which consisted of 10% glucose 500 ml, in order to correct her malnutrition, was started. She suddenly presented confusion, speech disturbance and ophthalmoplegia. HD with IDPN was stopped after two hours because of her symptoms. Laboratory studies disclosed plasma glucose of 186 mg/dl and serum ammonium of 155 micrograms/dl. Arterial blood gas analysis(inhaling 3 l/min O2) showed severe metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis (pH 7.138, pCO2 44.8 mmHg, pO2 108.9 mmHg, HCO3- 15.1 mmol/l). Her malnutrition, unexplained metabolic acidosis and neurological presentation raised the suspicion of acute encephalopathy due to thiamine deficiency. Fursultiamine 100 mg was administered intravenously. After two hours, metabolic acidosis disappeared (pH 7.437, pCO2 33.9 mmHg, pO2 161.0 mmHg, HCO3- 22.9 mmol/l), and she regained her clear consciousness and serum ammonium decreased at 16 micrograms/dl on the next morning. Serum lactate and thiamine level were shown later to be 57.5 mg/dl and 27 nmol/l, respectively.

We investigated the clinical features and outcomes of Shoshin beriberi using data from a nationwide database in Japan.Using the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database, we identified patients with Shoshin beriberi between July 2010 and March 2021. We retrospectively investigated the characteristics, comorbidities, treatment, and in-hospital mortality of patients with Shoshin beriberi. The chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables, and the Mann-Whitney U-test was used for continuous variables.We identified 62 patients with Shoshin beriberi. The median (interquartile range) age was 63 (48-69) years. Furthermore, 54 patients were male (87%). The most common comorbidity was alcohol-related disorder (34%). The median (interquartile range) length of hospital and intensive care unit stays were 17 (range, 10-35) and 5 (range, 1-9) days, respectively. The proportion of patients who received venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, intra-aortic balloon pump, continuous renal replacement therapy, and mechanical ventilation was 11, 5, 29, and 63%, respectively.

20020354,The consciousness circuit - an approach to the hard problem.,"This paper is the continuation of a study about Consciousness as a resulting function between attention and luminosity, presented at the Neuroscience International Congress, which was held in the city of Natal, in Brazil, in 2006. There it was described how visual Consciousness is generated by the interaction of the cortical area activity through FFS (Feedforward Sweep Processes), RP (Recurrent Processes) and WSRP (Wide Spread Recurrent Processes), and its relationship with the luminosity that hits the eyes. We have applied the reciprocal interaction model, which says that the eye reacts to luminosity through the regulation of sleep-awake states through EEG wave synchronization; this, in turn, is regulated by the thalamic cortical neural activity from the brainstem monoaminergic and cholinergic nuclei.Such an understanding has led us to construct a consciousness model which can be represented by an orthogonal graph. Through this model, we can represent all states of human consciousness (emotional consciousness, unconsciousness states, dreaming states, awareness states, pre-consciousness states and others) making it possible, in theory, to construct a Consciousness parameter which yields to the understanding of consciousness state observation without a subjective approach to experience.We have also applied on this orthogonal graph the Quantum Orch OR Model. According to it, subjective, phenomenal conscious vision depends on quantum computation in microtubules where the quantum is the smallest quantity of radiant energy, in a scale in which matter and energy interact. This model helps us to build the vertical axe of the consciousness orthogonal graph, a cholinergic-aminergic scale, in which activation triggers the quantum mechanism relevant to the consciousness phenomenon.",1,0.9157830545421796,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.41578305454217956

1424218,Cardiovascular responses to centrally applied sodium chloride solution.,"In conscious and anaesthetized rats the baroreceptor heart reflex (BHR) was checked before and after i.c.v. application of isotonic or hypertonic (0.6 M; 1.0 M) NaCl solution, artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) and 1.0 M mannitol solution. The BHR was tested by evaluating the alteration of the inter-beat interval (IBI) in response to an artificial BP rise or drop which had been evoked by i.v. bolus injection of either phenylephrine or sodium nitroprusside. The slope of the correlation function was taken to index the reflex sensitivity. In anaesthetized rats the mean sensitivity of the BHR was 0.6 ms/mm Hg (phenylephrine). l.c.v. administration of isotonic NaCl solution did not change BP, IBI or the BHR sensitivity, whilst i.c.v. infusion of hypertonic NaCl solution increased BP and shortened IBI. The BHR sensitivity was impaired only when 1.0 M NaCl solution was i.c.v. infused by 0.23 ms/mm Hg. In conscious rats the mean sensitivity of the BHR was 1.14 ms/mm Hg (phenylephrine) and 1.35 ms/mm Hg (sodium nitroprusside). In the conscious rats i.c.v. bolus injection of hypertonic NaCl solution increased BP as in anaesthetized rats, however, the IBI was prolonged, whilst 1.0 M mannitol solution and aCSF were without any influence on BP, IBI and BHR. l.c.v. administration of hypertonic NaCl solution reduced the BHR sensitivity by approximately 0.6 ms/mm Hg.",0,0.08451167785078118,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.4154883221492188

Twenty-two patients who completed a 2-week pretest, were randomized to either treatment or wait list control, followed by a 2-week posttreatment/control period. Treatment comprised electromyograph and thermal biofeedback, autogenic and progressive relaxation, and symptom-specific recommendations. Significant differences (p < .05) between groups were observed in the headache index and loss of consciousness, favoring the BFRT group. Both groups decreased state anxiety and depression. The Millon Behavioral Health Inventory was used to assess patients' coping style and adjustment to illness. The majority of the adult participants evidenced illness overreaction, preoccupation with illness, depressive feelings, and tendencies to nonadherence to therapy.

25263935,"Why is ""blindsight"" blind? A new perspective on primary visual cortex, recurrent activity and visual awareness.","The neuropsychological phenomenon of blindsight has been taken to suggest that the primary visual cortex (V1) plays a unique role in visual awareness, and that extrastriate activation needs to be fed back to V1 in order for the content of that activation to be consciously perceived. The aim of this review is to evaluate this theoretical framework and to revisit its key tenets. Firstly, is blindsight truly a dissociation of awareness and visual detection? Secondly, is there sufficient evidence to rule out the possibility that the loss of awareness resulting from a V1 lesion simply reflects reduced extrastriate responsiveness, rather than a unique role of V1 in conscious experience? Evaluation of these arguments and the empirical evidence leads to the conclusion that the loss of phenomenal awareness in blindsight may not be due to feedback activity in V1 being the hallmark awareness. On the basis of existing literature, an alternative explanation of blindsight is proposed. In this view, visual awareness is a ""global"" cognitive function as its hallmark is the availability of information to a large number of perceptual and cognitive systems; this requires inter-areal long-range synchronous oscillatory activity. For these oscillations to arise, a specific temporal profile of neuronal activity is required, which is established through recurrent feedback activity involving V1 and the extrastriate cortex. When V1 is lesioned, the loss of recurrent activity prevents inter-areal networks on the basis of oscillatory activity. However, as limited amount of input can reach extrastriate cortex and some extrastriate neuronal selectivity is preserved, computations involving comparison of neural firing rates within a cortical area remain possible. This enables ""local"" read-out from specific brain regions, allowing for the detection and discrimination of basic visual attributes. Thus blindsight is blind due to lack of ""global"" long-range synchrony, and it functions via ""local"" neural readout from extrastriate areas.",1,0.9149689887519398,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.41496898875193977

The effect of anesthesia on aortoventricular catheter positioning was also evaluated. In anesthetized and open-chest preparations, the systemic and renal hemodynamics were not affected by catheter position or site of microsphere injection; however, myocardial blood flow was dependent on these variables. Variations in coronary blood flow were significantly greater when the catheter was in the aortoventricular position (34 +/- 3%) than with an atrioventricular catheter (11 +/- 2%, P less than 0.01), irrespective of whether the microspheres were injected into the atrium or ventricle. Comparison of anesthetized and conscious rats with aortoventricular catheter indicated lesser variability in coronary blood flow in the conscious rats (P less than 0.01). Therefore, the greater variability of coronary flow measurements in anesthetized rats was caused by the position of the cardiac catheter in the aortoventricular route. However, the variability caused by the aortoventricular catheter was much less in conscious rats. Therefore, coronary flow hemodynamic measurements (microsphere technique) are less variable when they are made in conscious rats.",0,0.08796823953637171,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.41203176046362827

Blood levels of radioactivity were monitored at 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120 minutes and at one and two days. Urine and feces were collected in metabolism cages for two days, at the end of which the dogs were killed and organs or tissues (kidneys, liver, spleen, lungs, thyroid glands, heart, gonads, and muscle) were sampled. Radioactivity in tissues and excreta was assayed. Biexponential disappearance of radioactivity from blood was observed in three of four dogs at each dose level. Distribution half-lives averaged 2.5 to 3.5 minutes. Elimination half-lives averaged 51 to 54 minutes. Volumes of distribution averaged 25% to 27% of body weight. No organ retention was evident at 48 hours. Recovery of ioversol in urine and feces averaged 86% to 88% of the administered dose, of which all but a few percent was recovered in urine. On chromatographic assay, ioversol accounted for an average of 103% to 109% of radioiodine, suggesting, within the experimental limits of the assay, that ioversol is excreted unchanged. No dose-related differences were evident in any of these measures.

29286838,Patients' self-esteem before and after chemical peeling procedure.,"INTRODUCTION: Chemical peeling is a safe method, widely used to treat a variety of skin conditions and reduce the aging effects. This study aims to evaluate self-esteem among adolescents who undergo chemical peelings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty six patients constituted the study group. Sixty seven individuals had undergone chemical peeling for therapeutic reasons and 59 individuals for cosmetic reasons. To assess patients' self-esteem, the Rosenberg's Self-esteem Scale (RSES) was used before and after treatment. The control group included 71 healthy, age- and sex-matched volunteers from the general population. They were also asked to complete the RSES, after the same time interval as the patients. RESULTS: The healthy controls (23.01 +/- 3.12) presented statistically significantly higher self-esteem than both the groups of individuals who would be submitted to chemical peeling. Furthermore, patients who would undergo peeling for therapeutic reasons (21.58 +/- 3.20) had statistically significantly higher self-esteem than those who would undergo the procedure for cosmetic reasons (18.97 +/- 3.36). After the chemical peeling sessions, the self-esteem of patients treated for therapeutic reasons (23.48 +/- 2.43) and of patients treated for cosmetic reasons (22.83 +/- 3.34) improved statistically significantly, while the self-esteem of the healthy controls remained stable, as expected. CONCLUSION: Patients who undergo chemical peelings tend to have low levels of self-esteem. Although facial lesions in skin diseases such as acne, acne scars, rosacea, and melasma seem to have negative effect on individuals' self-consciousness, patients who would be submitted to chemical peeling in order to treat wrinkles, loss of radiance, and skin tone clarity have even lower self-esteem. Chemical peelings were shown to favorably affect patient's self-esteem since all patients showed an increase in self-esteem after treatment, while the control group experienced no change.",0,0.09356902440114782,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.40643097559885216

26363579,The neural basis of one's own conscious and unconscious emotional states.,"The study of emotional states has recently received considerable attention within the cognitive and neural sciences. However, limited work has been done to synthesize this growing body of literature within a coherent hierarchical, neuro-cognitive framework. In this article, we review evidence pertaining to three interacting hierarchical neural systems associated with the generation, perception and regulation of one's own emotional state. In the framework we propose, emotion generation proceeds through a series of appraisal mechanisms - some of which appear to require more cognitively sophisticated computational processing (and hence more time) than others - that ultimately trigger iterative adjustments to one's bodily state (as well as to the modes of processing in other cognitive systems). Perceiving one's own emotions then involves a multi-stage interoceptive/somatosensory process by which these body state patterns are detected and assigned conceptual emotional meaning. Finally, emotion regulation can be understood as a hierarchical control system that, at various levels, modulates autonomic reactions, appraisal mechanisms, attention, the contents of working memory, and goal-directed action selection. We highlight implications this integrative model may have for competing theories of emotion and emotional consciousness and for guiding future research.",1,0.9057271595874878,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.40572715958748784

To describe the adjustment of propofol to meet the needs of neurophysiological monitoring. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study of patients undergoing stereotactic microelectrode-guided deep brain surgery (stereotactic pallidotomy, implantation of electrodes in the thalamic or subthalamic neurons of the globus pallidus). After placement of a stereotactic frame and completion of a computed tomography scan of the head, the patients were transferred to the operating room. Monitoring included electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, arterial pressure (invasive), endtidal carbon dioxide pressure, and diuresis. Anesthesia was maintained by intermittent infusion of propofol. Variables recorded were age, sex, disease and time elapsed since diagnosis, surgical complications and their treatment, total dose of propofol, duration of surgery, and place of transfer for recovery. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-eight patients (50 women, 78 men) with a mean (+/- SD) age of 59.6 +/- 10.2 years underwent the procedure from 1996 through 2003. The mean time elapsed since diagnosis of the disease was 14 +/- 6.2 years. The propofol dose was 890.6 +/- 571.4 mg and duration of surgery was 8.3 +/- 2.4 hours. Adverse events were observed for 101 patients (78.9%). The most common complications involved hemodynamics: arterial hypertension (59.4%), bradycardia (18.0%), arterial hypotension (7.9%), and tachycardia (6.2%). Other more serious complications were pneumocephalus with clinical repercussions (3 cases), globus pallidus hematoma (2), air embolism (2), epileptic seizure (3), anisocoria (1), and dyspnea and/or airway obstruction (7). CONCLUSIONS: Deep brain stimulation requires surgery of long duration. Because of frequent episodes of arterial hypertension, which increases the risk of brain hemorrhage, and other less common but potentially dangerous complications, careful clinical monitoring is necessary during the procedure.

AVT (0.015-10 nmol) injected i.c.v. caused dose-dependent pressor responses; low doses also elicited tachycardia, whereas the higher doses (1 and 10 nmol) produced bradycardia. In contrast, oxytocin injections into the lateral ventricle (0.015-100 nmol) had no significant cardiovascular effects. Plasma vasopressin was not affected by i.c.v. administration of oxytocin or AVT except at the highest dose of AVT. AVT (0.1 or 1 nmol) and AVP (0.015 or 0.1 nmol) injected into the hypothalamic nucleus preopticus medialis (POM) increased blood pressure and heart rate; these changes were much greater than with comparable doses of AVT injected i.c.v. Plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine, but not vasopressin, were significantly elevated during the pressor period induced by 1 nmol of AVT injected into the POM. The pressor and cardiac accelerating effects of AVT (1 nmol) injected into the POM were significantly diminished in bilaterally adrenal demedullated, bretylium-treated rats. These data suggest a role for AVT, but not oxytocin, in central cardiovascular control through activation of the sympathoadrenomedullary axis.

11164029,Are we explaining consciousness yet?,"Theorists are converging from quite different quarters on a version of the global neuronal workspace model of consciousness, but there are residual confusions to be dissolved. In particular, theorists must resist the temptation to see global accessibility as the cause of consciousness (as if consciousness were some other, further condition); rather, it is consciousness. A useful metaphor for keeping this elusive idea in focus is that consciousness is rather like fame in the brain. It is not a privileged medium of representation, or an added property some states have; it is the very mutual accessibility that gives some informational states the powers that come with a subject's consciousness of that information. Like fame, consciousness is not a momentary condition, or a purely dispositional state, but rather a matter of actual influence over time. Theorists who take on the task of accounting for the aftermath that is critical for consciousness often appear to be leaving out the Subject of consciousness, when in fact they are providing an analysis of the Subject, a necessary component in any serious theory of consciousness.",1,0.89965466433744,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.39965466433744

The PHI was developed after analysis of 313 cases to provide an objective prehospital scoring system for distinguishing less seriously injured patients (minor trauma) from those patients who are likely to die within 72 hours after injury or who require general or neurosurgical operative intervention within 24 hours (major trauma). A PHI of 0 to 3 indicated minor trauma, and a PHI of 4 to 20 signified major trauma. Retrospective analysis of an additional 465 consecutive trauma cases revealed that patients with a PHI of 0 to 3 (minor trauma) had a 0% mortality and a 2% rate of general or neurosurgical operative intervention. Those with a PHI of 4 to 20 (major trauma) carried a 16.4% mortality and an emergency operative rate of 49.1%. The PHI was applied prospectively to 388 consecutive trauma cases presenting to the Butterworth Hospital Emergency Department from October through December 1984. Of the 351 patients scored as minor trauma in the field, there was a 0% mortality and only a 0.3% operative rate.

16368823,A comparison of state and response entropy versus bispectral index values during the perioperative period.,"Cerebral monitoring indices are associated with a large degree of inter-patient variability and electrical signal interference during surgery. We designed this clinical study to test the hypothesis that use of the spectral entropy (Entropy) module is associated with less frequent intraoperative interference with the displayed indices than the bispectral index (BIS) monitor when used during general anesthesia with propofol and desflurane. Thirty consenting patients scheduled for major laparoscopic surgery procedures were enrolled in this prospective study. The elapsed time to obtain a baseline index value was recorded, as well as the simultaneous state entropy (SE), response entropy (RE), and BIS values at specific time intervals during the induction, maintenance, and emergence periods in patients administered a standardized general anesthetic technique. During the maintenance period, the changes in these indices were evaluated after a bolus dose of propofol (20 mg IV) and a 2% increase or decrease in the inspired concentration of desflurane. As expected, the baseline SE values were less than the RE and BIS values (88 +/- 2 versus 96 +/- 3 and 96 +/- 4, respectively). However, the SE and RE values correlated with the BIS value during the induction (r = 0.77 and 0.78, respectively) and emergence (r = 0.86 and 0.91, respectively) periods. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for detection of consciousness also indicated a similar performance of the SE (0.93 +/- 0.04) relative to the RE (0.98 +/- 0.04) and BIS (0.97 +/- 0.04). During the maintenance period, the responses to changes in propofol and desflurane concentrations were consistent with all three indices. Finally, the entropy indices were less interfered with by the electrocautery unit during the operation (12% versus 62% for the BIS monitor). Because the average selling prices of the Entropy and BIS disposable electrode strips (14.25 dollars versus 14.95 dollars USD, respectively) are comparable, we conclude that the Entropy module is a cost-equivalent alternative to the BIS monitor.",0,0.10954689525828987,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.39045310474171013
11864644,Amiloride inhibits proximal tubular reabsorption in conscious euvolemic rats.,"Based on the results of micropuncture studies, it is generally assumed that amiloride inhibits Na+ (and Li+) reabsorption in the distal nephron, without affecting proximal tubular reabsorption. This is the basis for the use of amiloride to test for distal nephron Li+ reabsorption. We have examined the validity of this assumption by administering amiloride in doses of 0, 0.02, 0.07, 0.2 and 2.0 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) to conscious, chronically instrumented rats fed a diet with a normal Na+ and K+ content. Na+ and water homeostasis was maintained by servo-controlled replacement in order to avoid any effect of volume depletion on proximal tubular reabsorption. The effects of the two highest doses of amiloride were also examined without Na+ and water replacement. In the servo-controlled rats, the two highest doses of amiloride increased the fractional excretion of both Na+ (FE(Na)) and Li+ (FE(Li)), whereas the two lowest doses affected only FE(Na). In the rats without servo-control, FE(Li) also rose in response to amiloride infusion, but the increase was significantly lower than that observed in the servo-controlled animals. Since distal Li+ reabsorption is absent or negligible in rats fed a diet with a normal Na+ and K+ content, the large increase in FE(Li) following the highest doses of amiloride (15-18% of the filtered load in servo-controlled rats) indicates inhibition of proximal tubular reabsorption. We conclude that amiloride, in doses usually employed to detect distal Li+ reabsorption, inhibits proximal tubular reabsorption in conscious euvolemic rats.",0,0.11072308667847311,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.3892769133215269
26551893,Hypnosis modulates behavioural measures and subjective ratings about external and internal awareness.,"In altered subjective states, the behavioural quantification of external and internal awareness remains challenging due to the need for reports on the subjects' behalf. With the aim to characterize the behavioural counterpart of external and internal awareness in a modified subjective condition, we used hypnosis during which subjects remain fully responsive. Eleven right-handed subjects reached a satisfactory level of hypnotisability as evidenced by subjective reports on arousal, absorption and dissociation. Compared to normal wakefulness, in hypnosis (a) participants' self-ratings for internal awareness increased and self-ratings for external awareness decreased, (b) the two awareness components tended to anticorrelate less and the switches between external and internal awareness self-ratings were less frequent, and (c) participants' reaction times were higher and lapses in key presses were more frequent. The identified imbalance between the two components of awareness is considered as of functional relevance to subjective (meta)cognition, possibly mediated by allocated attentional properties brought about by hypnosis. Our results highlight the presence of a cognitive counterpart in resting state, indicate that the modified contents of awareness are measurable behaviourally, and provide leverage for investigations of more challenging altered conscious states, such as anaesthesia, sleep and disorders of consciousness.",1,0.8886478409264817,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.38864784092648175
8413932,Corticotropin-releasing factor release from the mediobasal hypothalamus of the rat as measured by microdialysis.,"Procedures were developed to permit the measurement of corticotropin-releasing factor in perfusate collected from microdialysis probes implanted in various brain areas of anesthetized and awake rats. Initially in vitro experiments were carried out to optimize the recovery of corticotropin-releasing factor and the radioimmunoassay conditions. Addition of a specific antiserum against corticotropin-releasing factor to the perfusion medium (artificial cerebrospinal fluid) increased the relative in vitro recovery over a range of different flow rates (1-10 microliters/min) using commercially available microdialysis probes with a membrane cutoff of 20,000 mol. wt. This procedure increased recovery from 3% to 6% at flow rate of 2.5 microliters/min, and from 4% to 8% at a flow rate of 5 microliters/min. In vivo experiments were performed with a flow rate of 3.3 microliters/min and 50-microliters fractions were used for radioimmunoassay. In each experiment, the standard curve of the radioimmunoassay was constructed from aliquots of the same medium used to perfuse the probe. Basal levels of corticotropin-releasing factor in dialysate collected from the mediobasal hypothalamus of anesthetized rats were estimated to be 0.75 +/- 0.07 fmol/50 microliters. Raising the concentration of potassium (60 mM) in the perfusate increased corticotropin-releasing factor levels to 2.04 +/- 0.37 fmol/50 microliters. Hypertonic stress induced by intraperitoneal injection of 1.5M NaCl (20 ml/kg) elevated the levels to 1.32 +/- 0.07 fmol/50 microliters. A marked increase of corticotropin-releasing factor levels was also produced by a 10-min pulse of the potassium-channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (10 mM) included in the perfusate. A second stimulation pulse with 4-aminopyridine, administered 2 h after the first pulse again increased the levels, with a mean ratio between the first and second pulse of 0.97. Corticotropin-releasing factor efflux produced by the second stimulation pulse was completely inhibited by perfusion with calcium-free medium containing calcium-chelating agent ethyleneglycol tetraacetic acid (10 mM). In separate experiments, microdialysis probes were implanted in several brain areas of anesthetized rats. Basal and potassium-evoked levels of corticotropin-releasing factor were measured in dialysate collected from the amygdala (1.20 +/- 0.22 and 2.05 +/- 0.48 fmol/50 microliters, respectively) and frontal cortex (0.51 +/- 0.10 and 1.64 +/- 0.15 fmol/50 microliters, respectively). Corticotropin-releasing factor levels in the dorsal part of the third ventricle and in the striatum were below the detection limits. In awake rats, corticotropin-releasing factor levels in the mediobasal hypothalamus were 0.98 +/- 0.03 fmol/50 microliters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0,0.11276788399424659,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.3872321160057534
26663652,Pathways Involving Beta-3 Adrenergic Receptors Modulate Cold Stress-Induced Detrusor Overactivity in Conscious Rats.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate pathways involving beta-3 adrenergic receptors (ARs) in detrusor overactivity induced by cold stress, we determined if the beta-3 AR agonist CL316243 could modulate the cold stress-induced detrusor overactivity in normal rats. METHODS: Two days prior to cystometric investigations, the bladders of 10-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were cannulated. Cystometric measurements of the unanesthetized, unrestricted rats were taken to estimate baseline values at room temperature (RT, 27 +/- 2 degrees C) for 20 min. They were then intravenously administered vehicle, 0.1, or 1.0 mg/kg CL316243 (n = 6 in each group). Five minutes after the treatments, they were gently and quickly transferred to the low temperature (LT, 4 +/- 2 degrees C) room for 40 min where the cystometric measurements were again made. Afterward, the rats were returned to RT for final cystometric measurements. The cystometric effects of CL316243 were also measured at RT (n = 6 in each group). RESULTS: At RT, both low and high dose of CL316243 decreased basal and micturition pressure while the high dose (1.0 mg/kg) significantly increased voiding interval and bladder capacity. During LT exposure, the high dose of CL316243 partially reduced cold stress-induced detrusor overactivity characterized by increased basal pressure and urinary frequency. The high drug dose also significantly inhibited the decreases of both voiding interval and bladder capacity compared to the vehicle- and low dose (0.1 mg/kg)-treated rats. CONCLUSION: A high dose of the beta-3 agonist CL316243 could modulate cold stress-induced detrusor overactivity. Therefore, one of the mechanisms in cold stress-induced detrusor overactivity includes a pathway involving beta-3 ARs.",0,0.11316377363014193,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.38683622636985804
2782444,Thromboxane A2 and serotonin mediate coronary blood flow reductions in unsedated dogs.,"We have shown in anesthetized open-chest dogs that recurrent platelet aggregation at the site of coronary artery stenosis and endothelial injury results in a pattern of cyclical variations in coronary blood flow (CFVs) and that serotonin and thromboxane A2 are important mediators of CFVs. In the present study, we tested the following hypotheses: 1) severe spontaneous reductions in coronary blood flow occur in awake closed-chest dogs with coronary artery stenoses and endothelial injury; 2) there is a progression from CFVs to persistent low coronary blood flow; and 3) serotonin and thromboxane A2 are important mediators of coronary blood flow reductions in this model. In 17 of 20 awake closed-chest unsedated dogs with experimental coronary artery stenoses and endothelial injury, either intermittent CFVs (n = 3), persistent low flow (n = 4), or progression from CFVs to low flow (n = 10) occurred during the first postoperative week. A serotonin receptor antagonist (ketanserin or LY 53857) or a thromboxane synthesis inhibitor (dazoxiben) or receptor antagonist (SQ 29548) abolished platelet-dependent CFVs in 80% of dogs. Thus 1) severe spontaneous reductions in coronary blood flow occur in awake closed-chest unsedated dogs with coronary artery stenoses and endothelial injury; 2) there is a progression from CFVs to persistent low coronary blood flow and final coronary artery occlusion; and 3) serotonin and thromboxane A2 are important mediators of coronary blood flow reductions in this experimental model.",0,0.11403753350876132,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.38596246649123866

This review will outline the advantages, applications and limitations of MVPA in understanding the neural correlates of consciousness. RECENT FINDINGS: MVPA has provided important insights into the processing of perceptual information by revealing content-specific information at early stages of perceptual processing. It has also shed light on the processing of memories and decisions. In combination with techniques to reconstruct viewed images, MVPA can also be used to reveal the contents of consciousness. SUMMARY: The development of multivariate pattern analysis techniques allows content-specific and detailed information to be extracted from functional MRI data.

12933405,Antinociceptive properties of neurosteroids: a comparison of alphadolone and alphaxalone in potentiation of opioid antinociception.,"In this study, we investigated the antinociceptive and sedative effects of the opioids fentanyl, morphine, and oxycodone given alone and in combination with two neurosteroids: alphadolone and alphaxalone. An open-field activity monitor and rotarod apparatus were used to define the sedative effects caused by opioid and neurosteroid compounds given alone intraperitoneally to male Wistar rats. Dose-response curves for antinociception were constructed using only nonsedative doses of these drugs. At nonsedating doses, fentanyl, morphine, and oxycodone all caused dose-dependent tail flick latency (TFL) antinociceptive effects. Because neither neurosteroid altered TFL, electrical current was used as the test to determine doses of neurosteroid that caused antinociceptive effects at nonsedative doses. Alphadolone 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally caused significant antinociceptive effects in the electrical test but alphaxalone did not. All three opioid dose-response curves for TFL antinociception were shifted to the left by coadministration of alphadolone even though alphadolone alone had no effect on TFL. Alphaxalone given alone had no antinociceptive effects at nonsedative doses and it had no effect on opioid antinociception. Neither neurosteroid caused sedative effects when combined with opioids. We conclude that coadministration of alphadolone, but not alphaxalone, with morphine, fentanyl, or oxycodone potentiates antinociception and that this effect is not caused by an increase in sedation.",0,0.11810176567872749,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.3818982343212725
27426098,Exogenous and endogenous angiotensin-II decrease renal cortical oxygen tension in conscious rats by limiting renal blood flow.,"KEY POINTS: Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the role of hypoxia in the initiation and progression of renal disease remains rudimentary. We have developed a method that allows wireless measurement of renal tissue oxygen tension in unrestrained rats. This method provides stable and continuous measurements of cortical tissue oxygen tension (PO2) for more than 2 weeks and can reproducibly detect acute changes in cortical oxygenation. Exogenous angiotensin-II reduced renal cortical tissue PO2 more than equi-pressor doses of phenylephrine, probably because it reduced renal oxygen delivery more than did phenylephrine. Activation of the endogenous renin-angiotensin system in transgenic Cyp1a1Ren2 rats reduced cortical tissue PO2; in this model renal hypoxia precedes the development of structural pathology and can be reversed acutely by an angiotensin-II receptor type 1 antagonist. Angiotensin-II promotes renal hypoxia, which may in turn contribute to its pathological effects during development of chronic kidney disease. ABSTRACT: We hypothesised that both exogenous and endogenous angiotensin-II (AngII) can decrease the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in the renal cortex of unrestrained rats, which might in turn contribute to the progression of chronic kidney disease. Rats were instrumented with telemeters equipped with a carbon paste electrode for continuous measurement of renal cortical tissue PO2. The method reproducibly detected acute changes in cortical oxygenation induced by systemic hyperoxia and hypoxia. In conscious rats, renal cortical PO2 was dose-dependently reduced by intravenous AngII. Reductions in PO2 were significantly greater than those induced by equi-pressor doses of phenylephrine. In anaesthetised rats, renal oxygen consumption was not affected, and filtration fraction was increased only in the AngII infused animals. Oxygen delivery decreased by 50% after infusion of AngII and renal blood flow (RBF) fell by 3.3 ml min(-1) . Equi-pressor infusion of phenylephrine did not significantly reduce RBF or renal oxygen delivery. Activation of the endogenous renin-angiotensin system in Cyp1a1Ren2 transgenic rats reduced cortical tissue PO2. This could be reversed within minutes by pharmacological angiotensin-II receptor type 1 (AT(1) R) blockade. Thus AngII is an important modulator of renal cortical oxygenation via AT(1) receptors. AngII had a greater influence on cortical oxygenation than did phenylephrine. This phenomenon appears to be attributable to the profound impact of AngII on renal oxygen delivery. We conclude that the ability of AngII to promote renal cortical hypoxia may contribute to its influence on initiation and progression of chronic kidney disease.",0,0.1185231075171399,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.3814768924828601

However, the time taken to process different attributes varies; consequently, we see some attributes before others. It follows that there is a perceptual asynchrony and hierarchy in visual perception. Because perceiving an attribute is tantamount to becoming conscious of it, it follows that we become conscious of different attributes at different times. Visual consciousness is therefore distributed in time. Given that we become conscious of different visual attributes because of activity at different, functionally specialized, areas of the visual brain, it follows that visual consciousness is also distributed in space. Therefore, visual consciousness is not a single unified entity, but consists of many microconsciousnesses.",1,0.8803984924058121,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.38039849240581214

Women's orgasms can be induced by erotic stimulation of a variety of genital and nongenital sites. As of yet, no definitive explanations for what triggers orgasm have emerged. Studies of brain imaging indicate increased activation at orgasm, compared to pre-orgasm, in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray of the midbrain, hippocampus, and the cerebellum. Psychosocial factors commonly discussed in relation to female orgasmic ability include age, education, social class, religion, personality, and relationship issues. Findings from surveys and clinical reports suggest that orgasm problems are the second most frequently reported sexual problems in women.

Epilepsy classification entails electrocortical characterization and localization of epileptic discharges (ED) using electroencephalography (EEG). HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Characterize epilepsy in Egyptian Arabian foals with JIE using EEG. ANIMALS: Sixty-nine foals (JIE, 48; controls, 21). METHODS: Retrospective study. Inclusion criteria consisted of Egyptian Arabian foals: (1) JIE group diagnosed based on witnessed or recorded seizures, and neurological and EEG findings, and (2) control group of healthy nonepileptic age-matched foals. Clinical data were obtained in 48 foals. Electroencephalography with photic stimulation was performed under standing sedation in 37 JIE foals and 21 controls. RESULTS: Abnormalities on EEG were found in 95% of epileptic foals (35 of 37) and in 3 of 21 control asymptomatic foals with affected siblings. Focal ED were detected predominantly in the central vertex with diffusion into the centroparietal or frontocentral regions (n = 35). Generalization of ED occurred in 14 JIE foals. Epileptic discharges commonly were seen during wakefulness (n = 27/37 JIE foals) and sedated sleep (n = 35/37 JIE foals; 3/21 controls). Photic stimulation triggered focal central ED in 15 of 21 JIE foals. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Juvenile idiopathic epilepsy has a focal onset of ED at the central vertex with spread resulting in clinical generalized tonic-clonic seizures with facial motor activity and loss of consciousness. Electroencephalography with photic stimulation contributes to accurate phenotyping of epilepsy. Foals with this benign self-limiting disorder might serve as a naturally occurring animal model for self-limited epilepsy in children.",0,0.12573198736690985,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.3742680126330902
29653378,"Possible origins of consciousness in simple control over ""involuntary"" neuroimmunological action.","The origin(s) and purpose(s) of consciousness continue to be fervently debated by neuroscientists. A recent unconventional hypothesis put forth by Morsella et al. suggests the primary function of consciousness is the integration, selection, and execution of advantageous lower-level voluntary skeletal muscle behavior on surrounding external environments. However, at main issue is whether more precise, adaptable voluntary skeletal motor action, and therefore the corresponding workings of consciousness, first emerged and evolved in animals to exert control over external environments or internal ones regulated by less flexible autonomic function. Using the example of voluntary immunomodulation, one can identify the strengths and weaknesses of either rationale. For instance, highly trained meditative techniques for immunomodulation more-or-less conform to Morsella et al.'s assumptions on higher-level indirect conscious control of autonomic function. Whereas, untrained skeletal motor resolution of infection-related approach-avoidance conflicts support conclusions contrary to those of Morsella et al. In such cases, primitive voluntary changes in host respiration rate and volume may selectively facilitate/inhibit acute autonomic psychophysiological stress responses to pathogen insult. This and other types of scenarios predictably give evolutionary and ecological rise to self-awareness of (visceral) internal states as well as to voluntary regulation of internal state action conflicts.",1,0.8737911224600127,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.37379112246001267

The woman, at 15 weeks' gestation, presented with hyperemesis gravidarum complicated by an episode of chest pain and disturbance of consciousness. Radiological examination revealed pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. They are normally caused by either pulmonary or esophageal rupture. The esophageal etiology was suspected as more likely because of the severe vomiting accompanied with it. Although the clinical feature was quite complicated and esophageal rupture is generally a life-threatening disease, we chose conservative therapy which resulted in rapid recovery. The final diagnosis was confirmed by endoscopic examination performed after recovery. Pneumomediastinum during pregnancy is rare but it could be lethal.

NPY caused particularly potent renal vasoconstrictions in intact rats of both strains. However, there were differential changes in regional vascular sensitivity of NPY following administration of pentolinium and captopril, indicating that 'buffer' mechanisms were an important determinant of responses to NPY. A marked mesenteric and low renal sensitivity to AVP was seen in both strains in all conditions. AVP was the most potent of the 3 pressor agents, and no evidence was found for it interacting uniquely with buffer mechanisms. The pressor action of AII was offset by a tendency towards hindquarters vasodilatation that was converted to a marked vasoconstriction when pentolinium and captopril were administered. It is feasible that, in the intact rat, AII stimulated adrenal medullary adrenal release which caused beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation that acted to offset the direct vasoconstrictor effects of AII.",0,0.12657574734332727,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.37342425265667273
2567709,Hemodynamic and renal responses to physiological levels of atrial natriuretic factor in conscious dogs.,"The effects of increases in plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) similar to those encountered after rapid volume expansion were examined in conscious dogs. Hemodynamics and renal function were continuously monitored during 30 minutes of human ANF infusion (10 ng/kg.min) and throughout a 30-minute recovery period. Ten minutes into the infusion period, plasma levels of ANF were elevated (p less than 0.01) by 34 +/- 9 from 36 +/- 5 pg/ml and sodium excretion increased (p less than 0.05) by 34 +/- 7 from 67 +/- 9 mueq/min. At that time, urine flow did not differ from baseline (0.25 +/- 0.03 ml/min). Renal blood flow velocity fell (p less than 0.01) by 5.0 +/- 0.5 from 42.3 +/- 3.7 cm/sec. Thirty minutes into the infusion period, plasma ANF levels were increased (p less than 0.01) by 61 +/- 9 pg/ml, similar to levels found after rapid volume expansion in conscious dogs. Urine flow and sodium excretion were elevated (p less than 0.01) by 0.35 +/- 0.06 ml/min and by 65 +/- 12 mueq/min, respectively. Renal blood flow velocity was reduced (p less than 0.05) by 4.4 +/- 1.5 cm/sec. Neither right atrial pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, mean arterial pressure, the first derivative of left ventricular pressure over time (dP/dt), nor heart rate were influenced by the elevated ANF plasma levels. Circulating levels of vasopressin and aldosterone were unaltered by these increases in plasma ANF. Thirty minutes into the recovery period, all variables were similar to the preinfusion baseline. Thus, in conscious dogs, physiologically relevant increases in plasma levels of ANF reached diuretic and natriuretic thresholds.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0.12817332907775056,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.3718266709222494
6427147,Cyclooxygenase inhibition during phorbol-induced granulocyte stimulation in awake sheep.,"In vitro, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) causes sheep granulocytes to release superoxide. Infused into sheep, PMA causes leukopenia, hypoxemia, pulmonary hypertension, and increased flow of protein-rich lung lymph. Lung lymph thromboxane B2 and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha levels rise markedly after PMA infusion. To see whether cyclooxygenase products of arachidonic acid mediate the lung vascular responses to PMA, we infused 5 micrograms/kg PMA twice in each of six sheep, once in the presence of sodium meclofenamate and once alone. We varied the order of paired experiments and allowed 4-7 days between experiments. Meclofenamate (5 mg/kg loading dose + 3 mg X kg-1 X h-1 infusion) given alone had no effect on base-line variables. Meclofenamate inhibited or delayed the initial pulmonary hypertension and hypoxemia after PMA but exaggerated the later increase in pulmonary arterial pressure; it prevented any increase in thromboxane B2 and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha after PMA. Meclofenamate did not affect the degree of leukopenia or the severity of the later hypoxemia nor did it prevent accumulation of granulocytes in the lung. Lung lymph flow was higher with meclofenamate + PMA than with PMA alone, but lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio was lower, suggesting that the main effect of meclofenamate on lymph production after PMA was related to the degree of pulmonary hypertension. We conclude that the early increase in pulmonary arterial pressure caused by PMA is mediated by a cyclooxygenase product of arachidonic acid, possibly thromboxane A2, but the later pulmonary hypertension and the increase in pulmonary vascular permeability are not the result of cyclooxygenase products.",0,0.12920401914452187,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.37079598085547816

The first impression was hemorrhage due to a ruptured aneurysm of the middle cerebral or the internal carotid artery on the left. Left internal carotid angiography showed no aneurysm or vascular anomaly, but back flow of contrast medium into the external carotid artery disclosed two saccular aneurysms arising from the anterior branch of the left middle meningeal artery (MMA). Emergent surgical intervention confirmed that the hematoma was due to ruptured MMA aneurysm.

WE is characterized by changes in consciousness, ocular dysfunction, and ataxia. Neuroradiologic findings usually show symmetric signal intensity alterations in the mammillary bodies, medial thalami, tectal plate, and periaqueductal area. Selective involvement of the cranial nerve nuclei, cerebellum, red nuclei, dentate nuclei, fornix, splenium, cerebral cortex, and basal ganglia characterize nonalcoholic WE patients. Furthermore, symmetric basal ganglia alterations with involvement of the putamen have only been observed in children. The incidence of WE is underestimated in both adult and pediatric patients. Interestingly, the frequency of WE in children appears to be similar to that observed in adults. The prognosis of the disease largely depends on the time from diagnosis to thiamine supplementation. The aim of this pediatric literature review is to provide an update on neuroradiologic findings in children affected by WE in an effort to determine pertinent clinical and imaging findings that can improve the detection and early identification of the disease. A thorough knowledge of the MRI findings of WE will assist in arriving at an early diagnosis, thereby reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease in children.",0,0.1378501519939204,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.36214984800607963

In normal subjects, increased sensory experience in Yoga Nidra meditation is linked to striatal dopamine release. We therefore hypothesize that the neurotransmitter dopamine may function as a regulator of subjective confidence of visual perception in the normal brain. Although much is known about the effect of stimulation by neurotransmitters on cognitive functions, their effect on subjective confidence of perception has never been recorded experimentally before. In a controlled study of 24 normal, healthy female university students with the dopamine agonist pergolide given orally, we show that dopaminergic activation increases confidence in seeing rapidly presented words. It also improves performance in a forced-choice word recognition task.

The available literature suggests an involvement of abnormal functional mechanisms in face recognition, mentalization and executive functions in adults with high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome, possibly due to brain maturation abnormalities, and resulting in dysfunctional reciprocal cortico-subcortical connections.

37400311,An Overview of Psychological Analysis of Breast Cancer Patients undergoing Modified Radical Mastectomy and Breast Conservation Surgery and its impact on Objectified Body Consciousness at a Tertiary Care Cancer Centre in South India.,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among females, and surgery plays a central role in its treatment. Surgical treatments may have a negative psychological impact on women's mental health regarding their body image. The purpose of this study was to compare the psychological health insights pertaining to objectified body consciousness scores before and after the surgery and also to observe whether these scores were comparable across the surgery types. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained data included 706 breast carcinoma patients who underwent either Breast Conservation Surgery or Modified Radical Mastectomy at tertiary care Cancer Centre, between the years 2020 to 2021. A validated questionnaire of Objectified Body Consciousness was used to obtain responses at diagnosis and at 6 months postsurgery and final scores were calculated for both instances. Two sample t-tests/analysis of variance and Chi-square tests were used to compare continuous and categorical variables respectively. RESULTS: Out of total 706 breast cancer patients, 402 patients underwent Breast Conservation Surgery and 304 underwent Modified radical mastectomy procedure. A statistically significant change was seen in the mean Objectified Body Consciousness Score (14.22 +/- 15.44) for all patients when compared preoperatively(72.72 +/- 11.38) and postoperatively(60.15 +/- 17.58). This change was higher in the Modified Radical Mastectomy group(29.38 +/- 11.53). Also, statistically significant rise in scores was seen with increasing age.

This G-producing capability is now beyond human physiologic G tolerance. Many techniques to raise the tolerance to HSG have been used operationally. In order to cope with HSG effectively, the Japanese Air Self Defense Force has given high-G training for certain fighter pilots since 1982. So far, 138 pilots (62 F-15 Trainees, 76 F-4 Trainees) have completed centrifuge training at our laboratory. The 1-week program consists of: physical examination and briefing on high-G stress and its protective methods on day 1; centrifuge rides in two basic patterns--a tracking performance and a simulated aerial combat maneuver (SACM)--during the period from day 2-5; and debriefing and questionnaires on day 6. Gradual onset run (GOR) relaxed tolerance is + 5.5 +/- 0.7 Gz and rapid onset run (ROR) relaxed tolerance is + 4.9 +/- 0.6 Gz (n = 126). The difference in G tolerance between F-15 and F-4 trainees was not significant in either GOR or ROR. Loss of consciousness (LOC) occurred in 18 F-15 trainees and 15 F-4 trainees during basic patterns but all F-15 trainees met the training goal and completed the SACM pattern on day 5 without LOC. More than half of the trainees developed a variety of arrhythmias, including PVC, SVPC, A-V dissociation, S-A block, and atrial fibrillation (AF).

35718056,"Proteomics on the role of muscone in the ""consciousness-restoring resuscitation"" effect of musk on ischemic stroke.","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Musk is a representative drug of aroma-relieving traditional Chinese medicine, and it is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Muscone is the core medicinal component of musk. AIM OF THE STUDY: We sought to identify the target of muscone in the treatment of ischemic stroke using network pharmacology, an animal model of ischemic stroke, and differential proteomics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The drug targets of muscone in the treatment of ischemic stroke were predicted and analyzed using information derived from sources such as the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database and Swiss Target Prediction tool. The animal model of focal cerebral ischemia was established by suture-based occlusion of the middle cerebral artery of rats. The rats were divided into six groups: sham-operated control, model, musk, muscone1, muscone2, and muscone3. Neurological deficit scores were calculated after intragastric administration of musk or muscone. The microcirculation blood flow of the pia mater was detected using a laser speckle blood flow meter. The cerebral infarction rate was detected by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. The necrosis rate of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampal neurons was detected by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Blood-brain barrier damage was detected by the Evans blue method. Quantitative proteomics analysis in the sham-operated control, model, and muscone groups was performed using tandem-mass-tags. Considering fold changes exceeding 1.2 as differential protein expression, the quantitative values were compared among groups by analysis of variance. Furthermore, a protein-protein interaction network was constructed, and differentially expressed proteins were analyzed by gene ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. RESULTS: Network pharmacology identified 339 targets for the intersection of 17 components of musk and cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. The GO and KEGG enrichment items mainly identified regulation of neuronal synaptic structure and transfer function, synaptic neurotransmitters, and receptor activity. Zoopery showed that the model group had a higher behavioral score, cerebral infarction rate, cortical and hippocampal neuron death rate, Evans blue exudation in the brain, and bilateral pia mater microcirculation blood flow differences than the sham-operated control group (P <0.01). Compared with the model group, the behavioral score, infarction rate, hippocampal neuronal mortality, and Evans blue content decreased significantly in the musk, muscone2, and muscone3 groups (P <0.05). Proteomic analysis showed that 160 genes were differentially expressed among the sham-operated control, model, and muscone groups. GO items with high enrichment included neuronal synapses, postsynaptic signal transduction, etc. KEGG items with high enrichment included cholinergic synapses, calcium signaling pathway, dopaminergic synapses, etc. Protein interaction analysis revealed that the top three protein pairs were Ndufa10/Ndufa6, Kcna2/Kcnab2, and Gsk3b/Traf6. CONCLUSIONS: Muscone can reduce neuronal necrosis, protect the blood-brain barrier, and improve the neurological damage caused by cerebral ischemia via molecular mechanisms mainly involving the regulation of neuronal synaptic connections. Muscone is an important active component responsible for the ""consciousness-restoring resuscitation"" effect of musk on ischemic stroke.",0,0.1452506781998338,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.35474932180016616

This has been termed ""stunned"" myocardium to differentiate the condition from ischemia or infarction. Because the influence of volatile anesthetics on the recovery of postischemic, reperfused myocardium has yet to be studied, the purpose of this investigation was to compare the effects of halothane and isoflurane on systemic and regional hemodynamics following a brief coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. Nine groups comprising 79 experiments were completed in 42 chronically instrumented dogs. In awake, unsedated dogs a 15-min coronary artery occlusion resulted in paradoxical systolic lengthening in the ischemic zone. Following reperfusion active systolic shortening slowly returned toward control levels but remained approximately 50% depressed from control at 5 h. In contrast, dogs anesthetized with halothane or isoflurane (2% inspired concentration) demonstrated complete recovery of function 3-5 h following reperfusion. Because the anesthetics directly depressed contractile function, additional experiments were conducted in which a 15-minute coronary artery occlusion was produced during volatile anesthesia; however, each animal was allowed to emerge from the anesthetized state at the onset of reperfusion. Similar results were obtained in these experiments, demonstrating total recovery of contractile function within 3-5 h following reperfusion. Thus, despite comparable degrees of contractile dysfunction during coronary artery occlusion in awake and anesthetized dogs, the present results demonstrate that halothane and isoflurane produce marked improvement in the recovery of segment function following a transient ischemic episode. Therefore, volatile anesthetics may attenuate postischemic left ventricular dysfunction occurring intraoperatively and enhance recovery of regional wall motion abnormalities during reperfusion.",0,0.14804745869173513,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.35195254130826487
10717785,What do reflex and voluntary mean? Modern views on an ancient debate.,"Are the words reflex and voluntary useful scientific concepts, or are they prescientific terms that should be discarded? Physiologists use these words routinely in their publications, in laboratory experiments and, indeed, like most lay people, in their daily lives. The tacit assumption is that we all know, more or less, what they mean. However, the issue has a rich history of philosophical and scientific debate; and, as this article demonstrates, present-day researchers still cannot reach a consensus on the meaning of the words and on whether it is possible to draw a scientific distinction between them. The five authors present five quite different analyses. In broad terms, they split into two camps: those who equate voluntary behaviours with consciousness and suppressibility and those who view all behaviours as sensorimotor interactions, the complexity of which determines whether they are reflexive or voluntary. According to the first view, most movements of daily life are neither purely reflex nor purely voluntary. They fall into the middle ground of automatic motor programs. According to the second view, as neuroscience advances the class of reflex behaviours will grow and the class of voluntary behaviours will shrink.",1,0.8508871657004388,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.35088716570043876

2227123,Calcitonin gene-related peptide and induction of hyperglycemia in conscious rats in vivo.,"The effect of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on glucose metabolism was investigated in conscious and unrestrained rats in vivo. Intravenous injection of rat CGRP (5.67 and 0.567 nmol/kg) caused a significant, dose-dependent increase in plasma glucose concentration and a simultaneous dose-dependent increase in plasma insulin level. In contrast, plasma glucagon level was not changed. On the other hand, intravenous infusion of CGRP (46.6 pmol.kg-1.min-1) decreased tolerance to intragastric administration of glucose (IGGTT). Plasma insulin response to IGGTT, however, was not affected by CGRP infusion. Moreover, although intravenous injection of CGRP (5.67 nmol/kg) elicited a significant increase in plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations, concomitant administration of epinephrine and norepinephrine, inducing a more prominent rise in plasma catecholamines than those induced by CGRP, affected neither plasma glucose nor insulin levels. Finally, plasma insulin levels obtained by simulating CGRP-induced changes in plasma glucose or glucose plus catecholamine levels by infusion of glucose or glucose plus catecholamines were not different from those induced by CGRP injection. These results suggest that CGRP has a hyperglycemic action that is not mediated by sympathetic outflow in conscious rats, and inhibition of insulin secretion, if any, does not play a major role in this hyperglycemic action of CGRP. We have demonstrated specific CGRP receptors linked to adenylate cyclase activation in rat liver plasma membranes; this hyperglycemic effect of CGRP in vivo may be partly due to its direct action on the liver.",0,0.1502606972590541,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.3497393027409459

8317147,[Consciousness and the brain].,"I.P. Pavlov wrote: ""First of all it is important to comprehend psychologically and then translate into physiological language"". On the examples of comparison of the evoked potentials with a theory of signal identification (A.M. Ivanitskii) and need-informational theory of emotions (P.V. Simonov) with the ""general low of human emotions"" (D. Price, J. Barrell) is demonstrated the efficiency of the simultaneous study of the higher brain functions by neurophysiological and psychological methods. Recent experimental data are underlied by the natural-scientific bases of consciousness. From the author's point of view consciousness is knowledge, which by means of words, mathematical symbols and artistic images may be shared with other individuals, with other generations in a form of cultural monuments. Recent studies by O. Grindel' have shown that preservation of connections between the gnostic cortical areas with the verbal brain structures is a necessary condition of consciousness functioning. The subconsciousness is well automatized and because of that no longer conscious skills, well learned social norms controlling behaviour and experienced as ""the voice of heart"", ""the call of duty"" etc. Super-Ego by Freud belongs to the subconscious sphere of the psychic. The superconsciousness (creative intuition) is an initial stage of a creative venture, uncontrolled by consciousness and will: initial closing of new temporary connections (whether they conform to the reality or not is defined only later). Actual controversy between determinism and freedom of choice may be removed by the complementation principle. The man is not free (determined) from the point of view of an external observer, who considers the determination of the man by genetic factors and educational conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1,0.8486555137743301,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.34865551377433013
3905726,"""Memory of the future"": an essay on the temporal organization of conscious awareness.","The classical tripartite concept of time divided into past/present/future components, has been applied to the analysis of the functional cerebral substrate of conscious awareness. Attempts have been made to localize and to separate the neuronal machineries which are responsible for the experience of a past, a present, and a future. One's experience of a past is obviously related to one's memories. Memory mechanisms (in the conventional sense) have a well known functional relation to superficial and deep parts of the temporal lobe. Some such mechanisms presumably have a more widespread distribution. The experience of a present or a ""Now-situation"" is mediated by the sensory input. This input also exerts a role for conscious awareness of an inner Now-situation, independent of current afferent impulses, as shown by numerous observations on sensory deprivation. The main discussion is devoted to the experience of a future. Evidence is summarized that the frontal/prefrontal cortex handles the temporal organization of behaviour and cognition, and that the same structures house the action programs or plans for future behaviour and cognition. As these programs can be retained and recalled, they might be termed ""memories of the future"". It is suggested that they form the basis for anticipation and expectation as well as for the short and long-term planning of a goal-directed behavioural and cognitive repertoire. This repertoire for future use is based upon experiences of past events and the awareness of a Now-situation, and it is continuously rehearsed and optimized. Lesions or dysfunctions of the frontal/prefrontal cortex give rise to states characterized by a ""loss of future"", with consequent indifference, inactivity, lack of ambition, and inability to foresee the consequences of one's future behaviour. It is concluded that the prefrontal cortex is responsible for the temporal organization of behaviour and cognition due to its seemingly specific capacity to handle serial information and to extract causal relations from such information. Possibly the serial action programs which are stored in the prefrontal cortex are also used by the brain as templates for extracting meaningful (serial) information from the enormous, mainly non-serial, random, sensory noise to which the brain is constantly exposed. Without a ""memory of the future"" such an extraction cannot take place.",1,0.8483295809553627,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.3483295809553627

16937158,Mapping slow waves and spikes in chronically instrumented conscious dogs: implantation techniques and recordings.,"Myoelectric recordings from the intestines in conscious animals have been limited to a few electrode sites with relatively large inter-electrode distances. The aim of this project was to increase the number of recording sites to allow high-resolution reconstruction of the propagation of myoelectrical signals. Sets of six unipolar electrodes, positioned in a 3x2 array, were constructed. A silver ring close to each set served as the reference electrodes. Inter-electrode distances varied from 4 to 8 mm. Electrode sets, to a maximum of 4, were implanted in various configurations allowing recording from 24 sites simultaneously. Four sets of 6 electrodes each were implanted successfully in 11 female Beagles. Implantation sites evaluated were the upper small intestine (n=10), the lower small intestine (n=4) and the stomach (n=3). The implants remained functional for 7.2 months (median; range 1.4-27.3 months). Recorded signals showed slow waves at regular intervals and spike potentials. In addition, when the sets were positioned close together, it was possible to re-construct the propagation of individual slow waves, to determine their direction of propagation and to calculate their propagation velocity. No signs or symptoms of interference with normal GI-function were observed in the tested animals. With this approach, it is possible to implant 24 extracellular electrodes on the serosal surface of the intestines without interfering with its normal physiology. This approach makes it possible to study the electrical activities of the GI system at high resolution in vivo in the conscious animal.",0,0.1526328592050122,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.34736714079498776

Re-examining introspective limitations in active and passive dual-task paradigms.,"There is a known introspective limitation in the Psychological Refractory Period (PRP) paradigm - people underestimate the dual-task costs on their second reaction time. The prevailing explanation for this is that conscious awareness of the second stimulus is delayed in time until the first task has been centrally processed. Here, we examined this effect in more detail, by comparing reaction time estimates after processing a PRP task, and after passively experiencing 'replays' of PRP trials. Even when participants had no dual-task processing demands, they did not accurately report the reaction time intervals using a visual analogue scale (the original reporting method of most introspective PRP experiments), but they did when placing markers that represent each event on a timeline. Thus, the timeline seems to better represent participants' introspective representation of the trial. Importantly, introspection limitations still existed when participants processed the PRP task and then recreated it on a timeline.",1,0.8473091100119059,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.3473091100119059

However, it requires interruption of sedation and may elicit a stress response. We evaluated the effects of the NWT using cerebral microdialysis (MD), brain tissue oxygenation (PbtiO2), jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2), and/or arterial-venous difference (AVD) for glucose, lactate, and oxygen in patients with severe TBI. METHODS: Seventeen intubated TBI patients (age 16-74 years) were sedated using continuous propofol infusion. All patients received intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) monitoring in addition to MD, PbtiO2 and/or SjvO2. Up to 10 days post-injury, ICP, CPP, PbtiO2 (51 NWTs), MD (49 NWTs), and/or SjvO2 (18 NWTs) levels during propofol sedation (baseline) and NWT were compared. MD was evaluated at a flow rate of 1.0 muL/min (28 NWTs) or the routine 0.3 muL/min rate (21 NWTs). RESULTS: The NWT increased ICP and CPP levels (p < 0.05). Compared to baseline, interstitial levels of glucose, lactate, pyruvate, glutamate, glycerol, and the lactate/pyruvate ratio were unaltered by the NWT. Pathological SjvO2 (<50 % or >71 %; n = 2 NWTs) and PbtiO2 (<10 mmHg; n = 3 NWTs) values were rare at baseline and did not change following NWT. Finally, the NWT did not alter the AVD of glucose, lactate, or oxygen.

23237630,Trying to cope with everyday life--emotional support in municipal elderly care setting.,"Emotional support is considered to be important to older patients because it is a contributing factor to experiencing good health and it has been shown that it can prevent depression after a hip fracture. Opinions differ on whether emotional support falls within the field of nursing, and studies also show that nurses in an elderly home care setting fail when it comes to giving emotional support. The aim of this study was to explore reasons for registered nurses to give emotional support to older patients in a municipal home care setting. The study was conducted using Grounded Theory. Data collection was carried out through interviews with 16 registered nurses. The inclusion criteria were emotional support given to patients aged 80 years and above living in ordinary or sheltered housing and who were in need of help from both the home help service and registered nurses. The results show that the main concern of emotional support was ""Trying to relieve the patient from their emotions so they are able to cope with everyday life."" This core category illustrates how registered nurses tried to support the patients' own strength, so that they were able to move forward. Registered nurses consider that they could support the patients because they give them access to, or could create access to, their emotions, but there were also times when they felt helplessness and as a result, consciously opted out. The results also indicate that registered nurses were keen to give emotional support.

The aim of this study was to determine whether a total colectomy can alter this motor inhibitory effect. METHODS: Beagle dogs were each equipped with four strain gauge force transducers on the upper gastrointestinal tract. The infusion of nutrients (saline as placebo control, oleate, butyrate, and glucose) began 90 min after feeding and continued for 30 min via a silicone catheter placed in the ileal lumen. Capsaicin (10 mg) was injected into the ileum as a bolus. All of the dogs underwent a relaparotomy and a total colectomy, and the same experiments were performed on all dogs. RESULTS: Before performing a colectomy, the oleate, the glucose, and the capsaicin were each found to inhibit the postprandial upper gastrointestinal motility in comparison to the placebo control (P < 0.05). The butyrate had no inhibitory effect. After a total colectomy, the inhibition of upper gastrointestinal motility was observed after the intraileal infusion of the oleate and the capsaicin (P < 0.05). The motor inhibitory response to the intraileal glucose was delayed after a total colectomy, and a reduction of the motility index was not observed in the gastric antrum and the duodenum because of this delay. However, a significant reduction in the motility index was observed in the jejunum. CONCLUSION: The intraileal stimuli-induced motor inhibition decreased after a total colectomy after the administration of glucose, but not after the administration of either oleate or capsaicin.",0,0.16297884977922017,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.33702115022077983

30609322,The Ganzfeld experience-A stably inducible altered state of consciousness: Effects of different auditory homogenizations.,"In the Ganzfeld technique, the visual and auditory perceptual fields are homogenized. After a short exposure to completely unstructured sensory input, participants transit into an altered state of consciousness. Visual homogenization is typically accomplished by a combination of goggles and bright light; auditory homogenization is accomplished by the presentation of unstructured auditory noise via headphones. The induced state is phenomenologically similar to a transition state between wakefulness and sleep, characterized by alterations in attentiveness, perception, and awareness, as well as by a compressed sense of time. Due to these replicable features of the Ganzfeld-induced state, it can be used within empirical research on the neuronal underpinnings of altered states phenomena. After a historic overview, here, we present data from a study on the stability of the subjectively experienced effects induced under different auditory homogenization conditions. In a fully randomized within-subject design (n = 24), we tested for the effects of three different auditory noise conditions: (1) violet, (2) white, and (3) brown noise. The combination of a standardized psychometric assessment, ratings on subjective time perception, as well as open reports prove the Ganzfeld-induced effects as being stable and effects within each participant as highly replicable, and therefore well suited for experimental purposes. Finally, the subjective experiences elucidated by the Ganzfeld technique are discussed within the framework of predictive coding and how changes in the interaction of top-down and bottom-up brain mechanisms could lead to the observed phenomenology.",1,0.8299443426559672,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.32994434265596717

We use high-density electroencephalogram to compare baseline sleep with sleep following performance on a task designed to assess both memory for and reactivity to negative and neutral imagery in 10 youths with posttraumatic stress disorder, and 10 age- and sex-matched non-traumatized typically developing youths. Subjective ratings of arousal to negative imagery (DeltaArousal = post-sleep minus pre-sleep arousal ratings) remain unchanged in youth with posttraumatic stress disorder following sleep (mean increase 0.15, CI -0.28 to +0.58), but decreased in TD youth (mean decrease -1.0, 95% CI -1.44 to -0.58). DeltaArousal, or affective habituation, was negatively correlated with global change in slow-wave activity power (rho = -0.58, p = .008). When considered topographically, the correlation between Deltaslow-wave activity power and affective habituation was most significant in a frontal cluster of 27 electrodes (Spearman, rho = -0.51, p = .021). Our results highlight the importance of slow-wave sleep for adaptive emotional processing in youth, and have implications for symptom persistence in paediatric posttraumatic stress disorder. Impairments in slow-wave activity may represent a modifiable risk factor in paediatric posttraumatic stress disorder.",0,0.1702400725879838,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.3297599274120162

Since the cerebral damage in low-velocity missile injuries is usually focal, there might not be disturbance of consciousness until secondary brain damage occurs; therefore, adequate medical supervision is necessary to prevent and treat potentially fatal complications in a timely manner. This is a rare case of a penetrating missile wound of the head, most likely caused by the use of a stone propelled by a slingshot that penetrated the skull and lacerated the brain with the stone embedded within the substance of the brain.

It is little investigated, perhaps partly because it is difficult to detect the mysterious periods of blanking. In this study, we found that our participants could intentionally produce a state of MB whose neural correlates were deactivation of Broca's area and parts of the default mode network (namely, the hippocampus) which would be active during mind wandering (MW), in addition to activity in another region in the default mode network (namely, anterior cingulate cortex). Because the behavioral finding replicates a previous report of ours, we suggest that the simple instructions that we used to induce MB should be effective. From the neuroimaging data, we conclude that we cannot define the content of our thoughts during MB because our inner speech system does not work at that time. Another possibility is that we actually think of nothing in the MB state.

21565451,The conscious mind and its emergent properties; an analysis based on decision theory.,The process of conscious and unconscious decision making is analyzed using decision theory. An essential part of an optimum decision strategy is the assessment of values and costs associated with correct and incorrect decisions. In the case of unconscious decisions this involves an automatic process akin to computation using numerical values. But for conscious decisions the conscious mind must experience the outcome of the decision as pleasure or pain. It is suggested that the rules of behavior are programmed in our genes but modified by experience of the society in which we are reared. Our unconscious then uses the rules to reward or punish our conscious mind for the decisions it makes. This is relevant to concepts of altruism and religion in society. It is consistent with the observation that we prefer beauty to utility. The decision theory equations also explain the paradox that a single index of happiness can be applied in society. The symptoms of mental illness can be due to appropriate or inappropriate action by the unconscious. The former indicates a psychological conflict between conscious and unconscious decision making. Inappropriate action indicates that a pathological process has switched on genetic networks that should be switched off.,1,0.8212442115280482,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.32124421152804816

A few studies have attempted this goal but involved either non-standardized instruments, limited temporal accuracy or samples, or focused on (sub)acute patients. The objective of this study was to describe the behavioral signs that led to a change of diagnosis, as well as the factors influencing this transition, in a large sample of patients with chronic disorders of consciousness after severe brain injury. In this retrospective cohort study, 185 patients in UWS/VS or MCS were assessed with the Coma Recovery Scale Revised (CRS-R) five times within the two weeks following their admission to a neurorehabilitation center and then weekly until emergence from MCS, discharge or death. Of these 185 patients, 33 patients in UWS/VS and 45 patients in MCS transitioned to another state. Transition to MCS was mostly denoted by one behavioral sign (72%), predominantly visual fixation (57%), followed by localization to noxious stimulation (27%), visual pursuit (21%) and object manipulation (12%), and could be predicted by etiology, time post-injury and age. Emergence from MCS was characterized by one sign in 64% of patients and by two signs (functional communication and objects use) in the remaining cases, and could be predicted by time post-injury and number of behavioral signs at admission. Clinicians should be therefore advised to pay particular attention to visual and motor subscales of the CRS-R to detect behavioral recovery.",0,0.17946457023295695,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.3205354297670431
37390767,"Visual perspective, distance, and felt presence of others in dreams.","The peripersonal space, that is, the limited space surrounding the body, involves multisensory coding and representation of the self in space. Previous studies have shown that peripersonal space representation and the visual perspective on the environment can be dramatically altered when neurotypical individuals self-identify with a distant avatar (i.e., in virtual reality) or during clinical conditions (i.e., out-of-body experience, heautoscopy, depersonalization). Despite its role in many cognitive/social functions, the perception of peripersonal space in dreams, and its relationship with the perception of other characters (interpersonal distance in dreams), remain largely uncharted. The present study aimed to explore the visuospatial properties of this space, which is likely to underlie self-location as well as self/other distinction in dreams. 530 healthy volunteers answered a web-based questionnaire to measure their dominant visuo-spatial perspective in dreams, the frequency of recall for felt distances between their dream self and other dream characters, and the dreamers' viewing angle of other dream characters. Most participants reported dream experiences from a first-person perspective (1PP) (82%) compared to a third-person perspective (3PP) (18%). Independent of their dream perspective, participants reported that they generally perceived other dream characters in their close space, that is, at distance of either between 0 and 90 cm, or 90-180 cm, than in further spaces (180-270 cm). Regardless of the perspective (1PP or 3PP), both groups also reported more frequently seeing other dream characters from eye level (0 degrees angle of viewing) than from above (30 degrees and 60 degrees ) or below eye level (-30 degrees and -60 degrees ). Moreover, the intensity of sensory experiences in dreams, as measured by the Bodily Self-Consciousness in Dreams Questionnaire, was higher in individuals who habitually see other dream characters closer to their personal dream self (i.e., within 0-90 cm and 90-180 cm). These preliminary findings offer a new, phenomenological account of space representation in dreams with regards to the felt presence of others.

22712593,Repression and substitutive formation: the relationship between Freud's concepts reconsidered.,"This paper examines Freud's concept of repression and the relationship between repression and substitutive formation as it presents itself in Freud's writings. The author shows that Freud gives at least four different meanings to the term ""repression"": Freud uses it interchangeably with defense, as a consciously intended forgetting, as a specific unconscious mechanism of defense, and to describe the consequence of defense mechanisms leading to substitutive formations. The inconsistencies in this relationship are discussed and clarified, and Freud's economic and linguistic attempts at founding repression are subjected to critique; the need of a primal repression as a necessary condition for repression proper is pointed out. In developing Freud's linguistic foundation of repression further, the author presents defense as a semantic displacement. Ideas are excluded from the realm of the concepts that belong to them historically. These presentations become unconscious, that is, repressed, in that they can no longer be identified as ""cases"" of these conceptual internal contents. At the same time they are displaced into the extensions of concepts whose internal contents do not belong to them originally. It is by virtue of the internal contents of these concepts that the displaced elements as substitutive formations once again attain consciousness, albeit a false one. The author suggests dismissing repression as a specific defense mechanism of its own; to reversing Freud's thesis that repression, as a rule, creates a substitutive formation into its opposite; and recognizing that the mechanisms used to build substitutes, as a rule, create repression.",0,0.18216925426112823,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.31783074573887177

Recent basic and clinical research with psychotomimetic drugs, such as the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist, ketamine, and the serotonin-2A (5-HT(2A)) receptor agonist, psilocybin, suggest that the hallucinogenic effects of these drugs arise, at least in part, from their common capacity to disrupt thalamo-cortical gating of external and internal information to the cortex. Deficient gating of sensory and cognitive information is thought to result in an overloading inundation of information and subsequent cognitive fragmentation and psychosis. Cross-species studies of homologues gating functions, such as prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex, in animal and human models of psychosis corroborate this view and provide a translational testing mechanism for the exploration of novel pathophysiologic and therapeutic hypotheses relevant to psychotic disorders, such as the group of schizophrenias.",1,0.8048995031191644,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.30489950311916436

These signals were recorded using a purpose-built telemetry-logging system, small enough to be worn by each bird in a spandex backpack. The birds were euthanized in a scaled-down CAS apparatus consisting of a conveyor belt passing through 2 compartments. Three gas environments were applied (8 birds per treatment): 1) anoxia (N(2) with <2% residual O(2), in both compartments), 2) hypercapnic anoxia (N(2) with 30% CO(2) and <2% residual O(2), in both compartments), and 3) a 2-phase approach with a hypercapnic hyperoxygenated anesthetic phase (40% CO(2), 30% O(2), and 30% N(2), in the first compartment, 80 s) followed by a second euthanasia phase (80% CO(2) in air, in the second compartment). All 3 CAS approaches effectively achieved nonrecovery states, and time to loss of consciousness for each bird was determined by visual determination of isoelectric EEG and by calculation of the correlation dimension of the EEG. Hypercapnic anoxia resulted in rapid unconsciousness and death; both anoxic treatments were associated with early onset prolonged wing flapping and sustained tonic convulsions as displayed in the electrophysiological recordings. These responses were seen in the period when consciousness remained a possibility. Hypercapnic hyperoxygenation (the 2-phase approach) was associated with respiratory disruption, but this treatment eliminated initial clonic convulsions in the stunning process, and tonic convulsions were not seen. These results suggest that the presence of O(2) in the first stage of CAS is associated with an absence of potentially distressing behavioral responses. The respiratory discomfort associated with hypercapnic hyperoxygenation is an issue. We propose that this may be compensated by a more gradual induction to unconsciousness, which eliminates the impact of other potentially negative experiences.",0,0.20406161661721753,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.29593838338278244

25957992,Conflict awareness dissociates theta-band neural dynamics of the medial frontal and lateral frontal cortex during trial-by-trial cognitive control.,"Recent findings have refuted the common assumption that executive control functions of the prefrontal cortex exclusively operate consciously, suggesting that many, if not all, cognitive processes could potentially operate unconsciously. However, although many cognitive functions can be launched unconsciously, several theoretical models of consciousness assume that there are crucial qualitative differences between conscious and unconscious processes. We hypothesized that the potential benefit of awareness in cognitive control mechanisms might become apparent when high control has to be maintained across time and requires the interaction between a set of distant frontal brain regions. To test this, we extracted oscillatory power dynamics from electroencephalographic data recorded while participants performed a task in which conflict awareness was manipulated by masking the conflict-inducing stimulus. We observed that instantaneous conflict as well as across trial conflict adaptation mechanisms were associated with medial frontal theta-band power modulations, irrespective of conflict awareness. However, and crucially, across-trial conflict adaptation processes reflected in increased theta-band power over dorsolateral frontal cortex were observed after fully conscious conflict only. This suggests that initial conflict detection and subsequent control adaptation by the medial frontal cortex are automatic and unconscious, whereas the routing of information from the medial frontal cortex to the lateral prefrontal cortex is a unique feature of conscious cognitive control.",1,0.7867130514124988,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.2867130514124988
29227852,Relationships between early literacy and nonlinguistic rhythmic processes in kindergarteners.,"A growing number of studies report links between nonlinguistic rhythmic abilities and certain linguistic abilities, particularly phonological skills. The current study investigated the relationship between nonlinguistic rhythmic processing, phonological abilities, and early literacy abilities in kindergarteners. A distinctive aspect of the current work was the exploration of whether processing of different types of rhythmic patterns is differentially related to kindergarteners' phonological and reading-related abilities. Specifically, we examined the processing of metrical versus nonmetrical rhythmic patterns, that is, patterns capable of being subdivided into equal temporal intervals or not (Povel & Essens, 1985). This is an important comparison because most music involves metrical sequences, in which rhythm often has an underlying temporal grid of isochronous units. In contrast, nonmetrical sequences are arguably more typical to speech rhythm, which is temporally structured but does not involve an underlying grid of equal temporal units. A rhythm discrimination app with metrical and nonmetrical patterns was administered to 74 kindergarteners in conjunction with cognitive and preliteracy measures. Findings support a relationship among rhythm perception, phonological awareness, and letter-sound knowledge (an essential precursor of reading). A mediation analysis revealed that the association between rhythm perception and letter-sound knowledge is mediated through phonological awareness. Furthermore, metrical perception accounted for unique variance in letter-sound knowledge above all other language and cognitive measures. These results point to a unique role for temporal regularity processing in the association between musical rhythm and literacy in young children.",0,0.21401495622740493,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.28598504377259504
14733903,Temporal organization of the brain: Neurocognitive mechanisms and clinical implications.,"The synchrony between the individual brain and its environment is maintained by a system of internal clocks that together reflect the temporal organization of the organism. Extending the theoretical work of Edelman and others, the temporal organization of the brain is posited as functioning through ""re-entry"" and ""temporal tagging"" and binds the wide range of possible times to a unified cognitive experience which is held in unison with the outside world. Dysfunction in this system is reflected in the temporal discord seen in cases of aging, sleep disorder, jet-lag, and shift-work, as well as in mental disorders and drug-induced changes in consciousness. The extent to which neuroendocrine structures contribute to the neurocognitive mechanisms which underlie consciousness has so far not been explored. Therefore, neuroendocrine mechanisms contributing to the temporal organization of the brain are reviewed. It is concluded that time-and its neuroendocrine correlate melatonin-is a binding principle for organizing conscious experience.",1,0.7828921321593482,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.28289213215934816
1685499,The use of flumazenil in the management of acute drug poisoning--a review.,"The popularity and widespread availability of benzodiazepines (BZD) has led to their frequent abuse in intentional drug poisoning. Although mortality from pure BZD overdose is usually small, in elderly, debilitated patients, or when BZD are combined with other CNS depressant drugs, morbidity increases significantly and outcome may be fatal. Drug overdose is therefore a medical emergency necessitating close observation and support of vital functions. Recently, the specific BZD antagonist flumazenil (Anexate) has become clinically available and much experience in its usefulness has accumulated. The present review summarizes a total of 30 studies and reports published to date, involving approximately 760 intoxicated patients. Flumazenil was evaluated both in prehospital use as well as in emergency rooms or in intensive care units. The age of patients ranged from 4-90 years and doses of flumazenil varied between 0.3-10 mg, approximately 1 mg being the most frequently used. All patients intoxicated with only BZD returned to full consciousness within minutes after the injection of flumazenil. When a mixture of BZD and other CNS depressants was abused, a range of effects was observed. This varied from no change to a return to full orientation, depending on the contribution of the BZD to the state of unconsciousness. Re-sedation occurred in about 65% of flumazenil treated patients, usually within 0.5-3 h after the first dose, the shorter interval being associated with mixed-drug poisoning. Repeated doses of the antagonist (0.2-2 mg), sometimes followed by continuous infusion (0.1-0.5 mg/h), were effective in maintaining patients fully oriented.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0.21991973538432585,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.28008026461567415

However, SBI has not yet been evaluated for persons who incur traumatic brain injury (TBI)-a substantial patient subpopulation for whom substance-related problems are frequent. To examine whether research on SBI efficacy and effectiveness can be generalized to persons with TBI, a systematic review of the literature was conducted to analyze how TBI populations were included in previous studies and whether there was evidence of differential outcomes. METHODS: Peer-reviewed studies that investigated SBI for misuse of alcohol or other drugs, that were implemented in emergency departments or trauma centers, and that were published in English since 1985 were examined. From 174 articles initially identified, 28 studies were determined to meet inclusion criteria. RESULTS: The review revealed that research conducted on SBI for injury populations systematically neglected patients with more severe TBI and those who presented with sufficient confusion that they could not provide informed consent. CONCLUSIONS: Future effectiveness studies should examine barriers to routine clinical use of SBI and evaluate the generalizability of expected benefits to the full spectrum of injured patients. Researchers should also develop and evaluate systematic accommodations for persons with neurobehavioral impairments who would benefit from brief interventions for substance misuse.",0,0.2236251989511562,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.2763748010488438
19526437,The influence of temporal factors on automatic priming and conscious expectancy in a simple reaction time task.,"In a previous study, we reported a dissociation between subjective expectancy and motor behaviour in a simple associative learning task (Perruchet, Cleeremans, & Destrebecqz, 2006). According to previous conditioning studies (Clark, Manns, & Squire, 2001), this dissociation is observed when the to-be-associated events coterminate and thus overlap in time (a training regimen called delay conditioning), but not when they are separated by a temporal delay (trace conditioning). In this latter situation indeed, there tends to be a direct relationship between subjective expectancy and behaviour. In this study, we further investigated this issue in a series of experiments where conscious and unconscious components of performance were pitted against each other. In Experiments 1-3, participants performed a simple reaction time task in which a preparatory signal (a tone) either overlapped with or terminated earlier than the imperative stimulus (a visual target presented in 50% of the trials). After each response, participants also had to state how much they expected the imperative stimulus to be displayed on the next trial. Results indicate that reaction times tend to decrease when the tone is consistently followed by the visual target across successive trials, whereas conscious expectancy for the target decreases at the same time. Importantly, we systematically found that the temporal relationship between the tone and the target failed to influence performance. In a fourth experiment, we examined whether these results extend to a two-choice reaction time task. To our surprise, we observed a direct relationship between subjective expectancies and reaction time in that situation. We nevertheless observed that the introduction of a delay between the tone and the target had, once again, no effect on performance.",1,0.7741098184462444,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.2741098184462444

BIS has been shown to lag behind the level of sedation during induction and emergence of sedation with propofol. In this study, we sought to determine whether BIS is a useful adjunctive maneuver to registered nurse-administered propofol sedation (NAPS) as measured by reductions in recovery time and doses of propofol administered. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial of 102 outpatients presenting for colonoscopy was performed. BIS values were recorded continuously in all subjects. Patients were randomized to receive NAPS with BIS visible to nurse and endoscopist versus BIS invisible to nurse and endoscopist. In phase 1 (47 patients), the nurse and endoscopist team were instructed to consider BIS (when visible) as only adjunctive information with regard to titrating sedation. In phase 2 (55 patients), the nurse endoscopist team was instructed to use BIS as the primary endpoint for titration of sedation, and to target BIS to greater than 60 (60-70 is deep sedation). RESULTS: In phase 1, the mean (SD) BIS value from scope-in (SI) to scope-out (SO) for BIS was 59.3 (9.9) and was not different from controls at 59.9 (10.1; p= 0.82). The mean (SD) propofol dose (mg/min) was 15.8 (5.6) and 17.2 (6.2) for BIS and controls, respectively (p= 0.45). The mean (SD) recovery time with BIS visible in phase 1 was 20.6 min (5.5) versus 19.2 min (4.5) in controls (p= 0.34). In phase 2, the mean (SD) BIS from SI to SO in those randomized to have BIS visible was 64.1 (5.4) versus 63.1 (8.5) in controls (p= 0.58). The mean (SD) dose of propofol (mg/min) was 16.1 (11.2) and 16.4 (12.3) for BIS and control groups, respectively (p= 0.92). The mean (SD) recovery time in phase 2 with BIS visible was 18.7 (3.5) versus 20.1 (5.6) in controls (p= 0.27). CONCLUSIONS: BIS did not lead to reductions in mean propofol dose or recovery time when used as an adjunct to NAPS for colonoscopy, or when used as the primary target for sedation. No clinically important role for BIS monitoring as an adjunct to NAPS has yet been established.",0,0.22677043353201728,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.2732295664679827

21867210,Network algorithmics and the emergence of information integration in cortical models.,"An information-theoretic framework known as integrated information theory (IIT) has been introduced recently for the study of the emergence of consciousness in the brain [D. Balduzzi and G. Tononi, PLoS Comput. Biol. 4, e1000091 (2008)]. IIT purports that this phenomenon is to be equated with the generation of information by the brain surpassing the information that the brain's constituents already generate independently of one another. IIT is not fully plausible in its modeling assumptions nor is it testable due to severe combinatorial growth embedded in its key definitions. Here we introduce an alternative to IIT which, while inspired in similar information-theoretic principles, seeks to address some of IIT's shortcomings to some extent. Our alternative framework uses the same network-algorithmic cortical model we introduced earlier [A. Nathan and V. C. Barbosa, Phys. Rev. E 81, 021916 (2010)] and, to allow for somewhat improved testability relative to IIT, adopts the well-known notions of information gain and total correlation applied to a set of variables representing the reachability of neurons by messages in the model's dynamics. We argue that these two quantities relate to each other in such a way that can be used to quantify the system's efficiency in generating information beyond that which does not depend on integration. We give computational results on our cortical model and on variants thereof that are either structurally random in the sense of an Erdos-Renyi random directed graph or structurally deterministic. We have found that our cortical model stands out with respect to the others in the sense that many of its instances are capable of integrating information more efficiently than most of those others' instances.",1,0.7721552664748262,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,False,0.27215526647482624

26377477,Intrinsic Functional Connectivity Patterns Predict Consciousness Level and Recovery Outcome in Acquired Brain Injury.,"For accurate diagnosis and prognostic prediction of acquired brain injury (ABI), it is crucial to understand the neurobiological mechanisms underlying loss of consciousness. However, there is no consensus on which regions and networks act as biomarkers for consciousness level and recovery outcome in ABI. Using resting-state fMRI, we assessed intrinsic functional connectivity strength (FCS) of whole-brain networks in a large sample of 99 ABI patients with varying degrees of consciousness loss (including fully preserved consciousness state, minimally conscious state, unresponsive wakefulness syndrome/vegetative state, and coma) and 34 healthy control subjects. Consciousness level was evaluated using the Glasgow Coma Scale and Coma Recovery Scale-Revised on the day of fMRI scanning; recovery outcome was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale 3 months after the fMRI scanning. One-way ANOVA of FCS, Spearman correlation analyses between FCS and the consciousness level and recovery outcome, and FCS-based multivariate pattern analysis were performed. We found decreased FCS with loss of consciousness primarily distributed in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCU), medial prefrontal cortex, and lateral parietal cortex. The FCS values of these regions were significantly correlated with consciousness level and recovery outcome. Multivariate support vector machine discrimination analysis revealed that the FCS patterns predicted whether patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome/vegetative state and coma would regain consciousness with an accuracy of 81.25%, and the most discriminative region was the PCC/PCU. These findings suggest that intrinsic functional connectivity patterns of the human posteromedial cortex could serve as a potential indicator for consciousness level and recovery outcome in individuals with ABI. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Varying degrees of consciousness loss and recovery are commonly observed in acquired brain injury patients, yet the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain elusive. Using a large sample of patients with varying degrees of consciousness loss, we demonstrate that intrinsic functional connectivity strength in many brain regions, especially in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, significantly correlated with consciousness level and recovery outcome. We further demonstrate that the functional connectivity pattern of these regions can predict patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome/vegetative state and coma would regain consciousness with an accuracy of 81.25%. Our study thus provides potentially important biomarkers of acquired brain injury in clinical diagnosis, prediction of recovery outcome, and decision making for treatment strategies for patients with severe loss of consciousness.",0,0.23110451275752997,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.26889548724247003
27078506,The good and bad of ambivalence: Desiring ambivalence under outcome uncertainty.,"Decades of past research point to the downside of evaluative inconsistency (i.e., ambivalence), suggesting that it is an unpleasant state that can result in negative affect. Consequently, people are often motivated to resolve their ambivalence in various ways. We propose that people sometimes desire to be ambivalent as a means of strategic self-protection. Across employment, educational and consumer choice settings, we demonstrate that when people are uncertain they can obtain a desired target, they will cultivate ambivalence in order to protect their feelings in the event that they fail to get what they want. Specifically, we show that people consciously desire to cultivate ambivalence as a way to emotionally hedge and that they seek out and process information in ways to deliberately cultivate ambivalence. We find that people are most likely to generate ambivalence when they are most uncertain that they can obtain their desired target. Depending on the outcome, this cultivated ambivalence can either be useful (when the desired target is not obtained) or backfire (when the desired target is obtained).",0,0.2349353898650324,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.2650646101349676

31087090,Action priming suppression by forward masks.,"Visual stimuli may produce strong and reliable effects on subsequent actions irrespective of their visibility. This dissociation between action priming and conscious perception of the stimuli suggests two ways of processing of visual stimuli. One way of processing leads to the emergence of conscious visual perception, and another way leads to action priming effects. Here we examined the influence of forward masks that precede the prime on processing for action. In three experiments, we found that forward masks can suppress and even abolish priming effects. Suppression was larger with strong rather than weak forward masks and with short rather than long prime durations. Similar suppression effects occurred with surrounding paracontrast masks and with overlapping pattern masks. Our findings emphasize that processing for action depends crucially on preceding stimuli suggesting that action priming may depend on the initial part of the response to the prime. Results indicate that the use of forward masks to reduce prime visibility may also reduce action priming and potentially other priming effects.",1,0.756743223279151,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.256743223279151

17847069,Effect of anesthetic structure on inhalation anesthesia: implications for the mechanism.,"Many previous attempts (e.g., the Meyer-Overton hypothesis) to provide a single set of physical or chemical characteristics that accurately predict anesthetic potency have failed. A finding of a general predictive correlation would support the notion of a unitary theory of narcosis. Using the Abraham solvation parameter model, the minimum alveolar concentration, MAC, of 148 varied anesthetic agents can be fitted to a linear equation in log (1/MAC) with R(2) = 0.985 and a standard deviation, SD = 0.192 log units. Division of the 148 compounds into a training set and a test set shows that log (1/MAC) values can be predicted with no bias and with SD = 0.20 log units. The two main factors that determine MAC values are compound size and compound hydrogen bond acidity, both of which increase anesthetic activity. Shape has little or no effect on anesthetic activity. Our observations support a unitary theory of narcosis by inhalation anesthetics. A two-stage mechanism for inhalation anesthesia accounts for the observed structural effects of anesthetics. In this mechanism, the first main step is transfer of the anesthetic to the site of action, and the second step is interaction of the anesthetic with a receptor(s).",1,0.7557693006992873,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.25576930069928727
15766888,Subjective experience is probably not limited to humans: the evidence from neurobiology and behavior.,"In humans, conscious perception and cognition depends upon the thalamocortical (T-C) complex, which supports perception, explicit cognition, memory, language, planning, and strategic control. When parts of the T-C system are damaged or stimulated, corresponding effects are found on conscious contents and state, as assessed by reliable reports. In contrast, large regions like cerebellum and basal ganglia can be damaged without affecting conscious cognition directly. Functional brain recordings also show robust activity differences in cortex between experimentally matched conscious and unconscious events. This basic anatomy and physiology is highly conserved in mammals and perhaps ancestral reptiles. While language is absent in other species, homologies in perception, memory, and motor cortex suggest that consciousness of one kind or another may be biologically fundamental and phylogenetically ancient. In humans we infer subjective experiences from behavioral and brain evidence. This evidence is quite similar in other mammals and perhaps some non-mammalian species.

1965246,[Consciousness and reflex].,"In the paper an analogy is drawn between functions of consciousness and scheme of reflex. Consciousness includes afferent part perception of external world, central one--thinking, and efferent one--decision about action and motor command presentation. The basis of higher psychic functions is the junction of reflexes in complicated complexes, singling out in their composition key structures realizing synthesis of qualitatively different information. The centers of integration at realization of afferent functions of consciousness are situated in posterior, and at efferent ones--in anterior brain areas. In the process of thinking predominantly afferent and efferent stages may also be singled out with corresponding localization of foci of interaction. Communicative function of consciousness is provided mainly by centers of the left hemisphere.

33635858,Integrated information structure collapses with anesthetic loss of conscious arousal in Drosophila melanogaster.,"The physical basis of consciousness remains one of the most elusive concepts in current science. One influential conjecture is that consciousness is to do with some form of causality, measurable through information. The integrated information theory of consciousness (IIT) proposes that conscious experience, filled with rich and specific content, corresponds directly to a hierarchically organised, irreducible pattern of causal interactions; i.e. an integrated informational structure among elements of a system. Here, we tested this conjecture in a simple biological system (fruit flies), estimating the information structure of the system during wakefulness and general anesthesia. Consistent with this conjecture, we found that integrated interactions among populations of neurons during wakefulness collapsed to isolated clusters of interactions during anesthesia. We used classification analysis to quantify the accuracy of discrimination between wakeful and anesthetised states, and found that informational structures inferred conscious states with greater accuracy than a scalar summary of the structure, a measure which is generally championed as the main measure of IIT. In stark contrast to a view which assumes feedforward architecture for insect brains, especially fly visual systems, we found rich information structures, which cannot arise from purely feedforward systems, occurred across the fly brain. Further, these information structures collapsed uniformly across the brain during anesthesia. Our results speak to the potential utility of the novel concept of an ""informational structure"" as a measure for level of consciousness, above and beyond simple scalar values.",1,0.7467835967087669,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.24678359670876693
15996485,"A model of the hierarchy of behaviour, cognition, and consciousness.","Processes comparable in important respects to those underlying human conscious and non-conscious processing can be identified in a range of species and it is argued that these reflect evolutionary precursors of the human processes. A distinction is drawn between two types of processing: (1) stimulus-based and (2) higher-order. For 'higher-order,' in humans the operations of processing are themselves associated with conscious awareness. Conscious awareness sets the context for stimulus-based processing and its end-point is accessible to conscious awareness. However, the mechanics of the translation between stimulus and response proceeds without conscious control. The paper argues that higher-order processing is an evolutionary addition to stimulus-based processing. The model's value is shown for gaining insight into a range of phenomena and their link with consciousness.

Recent evidence suggests that blindsight patients trained for an extensive period of time can learn to discriminate and consciously perceive stimuli that they were previously unaware of. So far, it is unknown whether these effects generalize to normal observers. Here we investigated practice effects in metacontrast masking. Subjects were trained for five consecutive days on the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) that resulted in chance performance. Our results show a linear increase in sensitivity (d') but no change in bias (c) for the trained SOA. This practice effect on sensitivity spreads to all tested SOAs. Additionally, we show that subjects rate their perceptual awareness of the target stimuli differently before and after training, exhibiting not only an increase in sensitivity, but also in the subjective awareness of the percept. Thus, subjects can indeed ""learn to see.""",1,0.7452545831280936,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.24525458312809356
33646273,Recovery of Consciousness and Functional Outcome in Moderate and Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"IMPORTANCE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to 2.9 million visits to US emergency departments annually and frequently involves a disorder of consciousness (DOC). Early treatment, including withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies and rehabilitation, is often predicated on the assumed worse outcome of disrupted consciousness. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the loss of consciousness, factors associated with recovery, and return to functional independence in a 31-year sample of patients with moderate or severe brain trauma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study analyzed patients with TBI who were enrolled in the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems National Database, a prospective, multiyear, longitudinal database. Patients were survivors of moderate or severe TBI who were discharged from acute hospitalization and admitted to inpatient rehabilitation from January 4, 1989, to June 19, 2019, at 1 of 23 inpatient rehabilitation centers that participated in the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems program. Follow-up for the study was through completion of inpatient rehabilitation. EXPOSURES: Traumatic brain injury. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcome measures were Glasgow Coma Scale in the emergency department, Disability Rating Scale, posttraumatic amnesia, and Functional Independence Measure. Patient-related data included demographic characteristics, injury cause, and brain computed tomography findings. RESULTS: The 17 470 patients with TBI analyzed in this study had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age at injury of 39 (25-56) years and included 12 854 male individuals (74%). Of these patients, 7547 (57%) experienced initial loss of consciousness, which persisted to rehabilitation in 2058 patients (12%). Those with persisting DOC were younger; had more high-velocity injuries; had intracranial mass effect, intraventricular hemorrhage, and subcortical contusion; and had longer acute care than patients without DOC. Eighty-two percent (n = 1674) of comatose patients recovered consciousness during inpatient rehabilitation. In a multivariable analysis, the factors associated with consciousness recovery were absence of intraventricular hemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.678; 95% CI, 0.532-0.863; P = .002) and intracranial mass effect (adjusted OR, 0.759; 95% CI, 0.595-0.968; P = .03). Functional improvement (change in total functional independence score from admission to discharge) was +43 for patients with DOC and +37 for those without DOC (P = .002), and 803 of 2013 patients with DOC (40%) became partially or fully independent. Younger age, male sex, and absence of intraventricular hemorrhage, intracranial mass effect, and subcortical contusion were associated with better functional outcome. Findings were consistent across the 3 decades of the database. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that DOC occurred initially in most patients with TBI and persisted in some patients after rehabilitation, but most patients with persisting DOC recovered consciousness during rehabilitation. This recovery trajectory may inform acute and rehabilitation treatment decisions and suggests caution is warranted in consideration of withdrawing or withholding care in patients with TBI and DOC.",0,0.2551380694850212,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.2448619305149788

Before this finding, most scientists would focus on the diencephalon (and anterior midbrain) but not more caudally. Stimulation of the medial bulbar reticular formation in the pontine and midbrain tegmentum resulted disappearance of synchronized discharge and low-voltage fast activity. The effects were mediated by a thalamic projection system. This finding was a dramatic departure from the early philosophers' ascription of the awake soul to the ventricles (Galen), lumbosacral cord (Plato), pineal gland (Descartes), and even from more modern nineteenth- and twentieth-century hypotheses that the corpus striatum or periaqueductal gray matter housed the ""seat of awareness.""

17921755,Missing links in phenomenological clinical neuroscience: why we still are not there yet.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The phenomenology or systematic study of the patient's subjective experience in neuropsychiatric disorders is widely recognized as important. The methods used, the type of 'knowledge' obtained and the relationship of these observations to standard methods of clinical neuroscience, however, remain ill-defined and highly controversial. RECENT FINDINGS: Advances in the phenomenology of consciousness, self, body-experience, time-perception and intersubjectivity of neuropsychiatric disorders have been made. This review examines two differing approaches to the phenomenological psychiatry-neuroscience interface: the neo-phenomenological approach claims that some of its key concepts (e.g. the hyperreflexivity/ipseity model, prereflective self-awareness) are able to constrain neuroscience; the existential-phenomenological approach counters that phenomenology's role is not to constrain neuroscience but to provide hypotheses for further experimental study. This review compares these two approaches and assesses the current success of their respective claims. SUMMARY: By integrating work of largely untranslated authors, such as Binswanger, Blankenburg, and von Weizsaecker, neglected or cited out of context in the neo-phenomenological approach, the existential-phenomenological approach provides the 'missing links' between phenomenology and clinical neuroscience in a newly emerging but still fragile balance between disciplines. Optimistic claims about the ability of recently proposed phenomenological concepts (neo-phenomenological approach) to constrain neuroscience are unwarranted.",0,0.2610755404131978,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.2389244595868022
27559833,Subthalamic deep brain stimulation modulates conscious perception of sensory function in Parkinson's disease.,"Subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is used to treat refractory motor complications in Parkinson disease (PD), but its effects on nonmotor symptoms remain uncertain. Up to 80% of patients with PD may have pain relief after STN-DBS, but it is unknown whether its analgesic properties are related to potential effects on sensory thresholds or secondary to motor improvement. We have previously reported significant and long-lasting pain relief after DBS, which did not correlate with motor symptomatic control. Here we present secondary data exploring the effects of DBS on sensory thresholds in a controlled way and have explored the relationship between these changes and clinical pain and motor improvement after surgery. Thirty-seven patients were prospectively evaluated before STN-DBS and 12 months after the procedure compared with healthy controls. Compared with baseline, patients with PD showed lower thermal and mechanical detection and higher cold pain thresholds after surgery. There were no changes in heat and mechanical pain thresholds. Compared with baseline values in healthy controls, patients with PD had higher thermal and mechanical detection thresholds, which decreased after surgery toward normalization. These sensory changes had no correlation with motor or clinical pain improvement after surgery. These data confirm the existence of sensory abnormalities in PD and suggest that STN-DBS mainly influenced the detection thresholds rather than painful sensations. However, these changes may depend on the specific effects of DBS on somatosensory loops with no correlation to motor or clinical pain improvement.",0,0.26234440452336605,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.23765559547663395
21833272,Consciousness and attention: on sufficiency and necessity.,"Recent research has slowly corroded a belief that selective attention and consciousness are so tightly entangled that they cannot be individually examined. In this review, we summarize psychophysical and neurophysiological evidence for a dissociation between top-down attention and consciousness. The evidence includes recent findings that show subjects can attend to perceptually invisible objects. More contentious is the finding that subjects can become conscious of an isolated object, or the gist of the scene in the near absence of top-down attention; we critically re-examine the possibility of ""complete"" absence of top-down attention. We also cover the recent flurry of studies that utilized independent manipulation of attention and consciousness. These studies have shown paradoxical effects of attention, including examples where top-down attention and consciousness have opposing effects, leading us to strengthen and revise our previous views. Neuroimaging studies with EEG, MEG, and fMRI are uncovering the distinct neuronal correlates of selective attention and consciousness in dissociative paradigms. These findings point to a functional dissociation: attention as analyzer and consciousness as synthesizer. Separating the effects of selective visual attention from those of visual consciousness is of paramount importance to untangle the neural substrates of consciousness from those for attention.",1,0.7372241581607238,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.23722415816072384

In a previous study on healthy volunteers, we adapted the auditory ""local global"" paradigm and showed that violations of global regularity elicited a PDR. Notably without instructions, this global effect was present only in participants who could consciously report violations of global regularities. In the present study, we used a similar approach in 24 non-communicating patients affected with a Disorder of Consciousness (DoC) and compared PDR to ERPs regarding diagnostic and prognostic performance. At the group level, global effect could not be detected in DoC patients. At the individual level, the only patient with a PDR global effect was in a MCS and recovered consciousness at 6 months. Contrasting the most regular trials to the most irregular ones improved PDR's diagnostic and prognostic power in DoC patients. Pupillometry is a promising tool but requires several methodological improvements to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and make it more robust for probing consciousness and cognition in DoC patients.",0,0.2721569518982299,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.22784304810177008
31133480,A fast and general method to empirically estimate the complexity of brain responses to transcranial and intracranial stimulations.,"BACKGROUND: The Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) was recently introduced to assess the capacity of thalamocortical circuits to engage in complex patterns of causal interactions. While showing high accuracy in detecting consciousness in brain-injured patients, PCI depends on elaborate experimental setups and offline processing, and has restricted applicability to other types of brain signals beyond transcranial magnetic stimulation and high-density EEG (TMS/hd-EEG) recordings. OBJECTIVE: We aim to address these limitations by introducing PCI(ST), a fast method for estimating perturbational complexity of any given brain response signal. METHODS: PCI(ST) is based on dimensionality reduction and state transitions (ST) quantification of evoked potentials. The index was validated on a large dataset of TMS/hd-EEG recordings obtained from 108 healthy subjects and 108 brain-injured patients, and tested on sparse intracranial recordings (SEEG) of 9 patients undergoing intracranial single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) during wakefulness and sleep. RESULTS: When calculated on TMS/hd-EEG potentials, PCI(ST) performed with the same accuracy as the original PCI, while improving on the previous method by being computed in less than a second and requiring a simpler set-up. In SPES/SEEG signals, the index was able to quantify a systematic reduction of intracranial complexity during sleep, confirming the occurrence of state-dependent changes in the effective connectivity of thalamocortical circuits, as originally assessed through TMS/hd-EEG. CONCLUSIONS: PCI(ST) represents a fundamental advancement towards the implementation of a reliable and fast clinical tool for the bedside assessment of consciousness as well as a general measure to explore the neuronal mechanisms of loss/recovery of brain complexity across scales and models.",1,0.7265984378076447,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.22659843780764466
1991911,Atrial activation sequence during atrial flutter in the canine pericarditis model and its effects on the polarity of the flutter wave in the electrocardiogram.,"Stable atrial flutter induced in both conscious and open chest states was studied in 30 mongrel dogs after production of sterile pericarditis. During the conscious state studies, induced atrial flutter (mean cycle length 128 +/- 15 ms) was always sustained greater than 15 min and was stable. Three types of flutter wave polarity were noted in electrocardiogram (ECG) lead II: positive in 16 dogs, negative in 3 and flat or slightly positive in 11. Sequential site atrial mapping during atrial flutter (mean cycle length 133 +/- 18 ms) in the open chest state showed either clockwise (18 dogs) or counterclockwise (12 dogs) circus movement in the right atrium. In 19 of 30 dogs, the circus movement clearly did not require any naturally existing anatomic obstacle; in 11, the orifice of the superior vena cava probably was also involved. Double potentials were recorded from the center of the reentrant circuit during atrial flutter, and fractionated electrograms were recorded from a pivot point of the reentrant wave front. A positive flutter wave in ECG lead II (12 dogs with counterclockwise circus movement) was associated with early activation of the Bachmann's bundle region compared with the posteroinferior left atrium and activation of the left atrium mainly in a superoinferior direction. A negative flutter was associated with the early activation of the posteroinferior left atrium compared with Bachmann's bundle and activation of a considerable portion of the left atrium in an inferosuperior direction. A flat or slightly positive flutter wave (14 of 18 with clockwise circus movement) was associated with activation of the left atrium almost simultaneously by two wave fronts coming from both these sites. In conclusion, atrial flutter in this dog model is due to circus movement in the right atrium, the center of which does not necessarily require an anatomic obstacle. Although atrial flutter is generated by circus movement in the right atrium, the flutter wave polarity in the ECG is determined primarily by the activation sequence of the left atrium.",0,0.27623969405972976,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.22376030594027024

Our aim is to communicate with patients with disorders of consciousness through asking them to answer questions with ""yes/no"" by performing mental imagery tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHODS: A 1.5 T fMRI study with 5 patients and a control group is presented. Speech comprehension, mental imagery, and question-answer tests were performed. RESULTS: The imagery task of mental calculation produced equally distinct activation patterns when compared to navigation and motor imagery in controls. For controls, we could infer answers to questions based on imagery activations. Two patients produced activations in similar areas to controls for certain imagery tasks, however, no activations were observed for the question-answer task. CONCLUSIONS: The results from 2 patients provide independent support of similar work by others with 3 T fMRI, and demonstrate broader clinical utility for these tests at 1.5 T despite lower signal-to-noise ratio.

21408105,Effects of unconscious processing on implicit memory for fearful faces.,"Emotional stimuli can be processed even when participants perceive them without conscious awareness, but the extent to which unconsciously processed emotional stimuli influence implicit memory after short and long delays is not fully understood. We addressed this issue by measuring a subliminal affective priming effect in Experiment 1 and a long-term priming effect in Experiment 2. In Experiment 1, a flashed fearful or neutral face masked by a scrambled face was presented three times, then a target face (either fearful or neutral) was presented and participants were asked to make a fearful/neutral judgment. We found that, relative to a neutral prime face (neutral-fear face), a fearful prime face speeded up participants' reaction to a fearful target (fear-fear face), when they were not aware of the masked prime face. But this response pattern did not apply to the neutral target. In Experiment 2, participants were first presented with a masked faces six times during encoding. Three minutes later, they were asked to make a fearful/neutral judgment for the same face with congruent expression, the same face with incongruent expression or a new face. Participants showed a significant priming effect for the fearful faces but not for the neutral faces, regardless of their awareness of the masked faces during encoding. These results provided evidence that unconsciously processed stimuli could enhance emotional memory after both short and long delays.

33459150,The reconstructive nature of involuntary autobiographical memories.,"Influential clinical theories propose that parts of traumatic or stressful events are stored in an unprocessed, purely perceptual form, which is inaccessible for voluntary retrieval but may spontaneously return to consciousness involuntarily in response to matching cues. This leads to perceptually vivid, and largely veridical involuntary memories of the traumatic scene, remembered with the original emotions and from the same vantage point as during the event. Several lines of evidence contradict this position. First, involuntary memories are not more veridical than memories retrieved deliberately. Second, involuntary memories for trauma-related events are not more frequently remembered with the original first-person perspective, and individuals with PTSD do not report more first-person involuntary memories than individuals without PTSD. Third, involuntary memories of stressful moments that are subjectively experienced as repetitive do not come to mind in a fixed and unchangeable form. Fourth, involuntary memories do not have privileged access to the most emotional moments (so-called hotspots) of a stressful event and the content and choice of hotspots change over time. Fourth, although involuntary memories are associated with enhanced emotional impact, this does not imply reactivation of the original emotion.

19059583,On the signals underlying conscious awareness of action.,"To investigate whether conscious judgments of movement onset are based solely on pre-movement signals (i.e., premotor or efference copy signals) or whether sensory feedback (i.e., reafferent) signals also play a role, participants judged the onset of finger and toe movements that were either active (i.e., self initiated) or passive (i.e., initiated by the experimenter). Conscious judgments were made by reporting the position of a rotating clock hand presented on a computer screen and were then compared to the actual measured time of movement onset. In line with previous studies, judgment errors were found to be anticipatory for both finger and toe movements. There was a significant difference between judgment errors for active and passive movements, with judgments of active movements being more anticipatory than judgments of passive movements. This is consistent with a pre-movement (from here on referred to as an ""efferent"") account of action awareness because premotor and efference copy signals are only present in active movements, whereas the main source of movement information in passive movements is sensory feedback which is subject to time delays of conduction (and hence predicts later judgment times for passive movements). However, judgments of active toe movement onset time were less anticipatory than judgments of active finger movement onset time. This pattern of results is not consistent with a pure efferent account of conscious awareness of action onset - as this account predicts more anticipatory judgments for toe movements compared to finger movements. Instead, the data support the idea that conscious judgments of movement onset are based on efferent (i.e., premotor, efference copy) and reafferent (i.e., feedback from the movement) components.",1,0.6990467528422213,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.1990467528422213
33715865,Reversible splenial lesions during febrile illness with or without white matter lesions.,"OBJECTIVE: Reversible splenium lesions during febrile illness (RESLEF) are found in a spectrum. There are two types of corpus callosum (CC) lesions: CC-only type, with limited lesions and the CC (+) type, with extensive white-matter lesions. This retrospective study aimed to describe the differences in clinical findings between CC-only and CC (+) lesions and the association between onset age and clinico-radiological features in RESLEF. METHODS: Fifty-two episodes of CC-only or CC (+) lesions accompanied by neurological symptoms, e.g., seizures, delirious behavior (DB), and disturbance of consciousness (DC), from January 2008 to October 2019 were included. We analyzed the etiology (pathogen), clinical course, laboratory data, magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography findings, therapy, and prognosis. RESULTS: The rate of DC in the CC (+) was significantly higher than that in the CC-only group (5/6 [83%] vs 7/46 [15%]; p = 0.0016). The median number of seizures in the CC (+) was also significantly higher than that in the CC-only group (4 [0-7] vs 0 [0-7]; p = 0.034). Further, in RESLEF, the median onset age (months) in the seizure was significantly lower than that in the no-seizure group (39 [12-74] vs 83 [28-174]; p = 0.0007). The median onset age (months) in the DB was significantly higher than that in the no-DB group (74.5 [26-174] vs 28 [12-139]; p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In RESLEF, CC (+) is a more severe neurological symptom than CC-only. Furthermore, the onset age is related to the type of neurological symptoms that appear.",0,0.300971961832553,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.19902803816744702

19266592,Non-invasive brain stimulation in the detection of deception: scientific challenges and ethical consequences.,"Tools for noninvasive stimulation of the brain, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have provided new insights in the study of brain-behavior relationships due to their ability to directly alter cortical activity. In particular, TMS and tDCS have proven to be useful tools for establishing causal relationships between behavioral and brain imaging measures. As such, there has been interest in whether these tools may represent novel technologies for deception detection by altering a person's ability to engage brain networks involved in conscious deceit. Investigation of deceptive behavior using noninvasive brain stimulation is at an early stage. Here we review the existing literature on the application of noninvasive brain stimulation in the study of deception. Whether such approaches could be usefully applied to the detection of deception by altering a person's ability to engage brain networks involved in conscious deceit remains to be validated. Ethical and legal consequences of the development of such a technology are discussed.",0,0.30291711756905315,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.19708288243094685
23691987,Does perceptual learning require consciousness or attention?,"It has been proposed that visual attention and consciousness are separate [Koch, C., & Tsuchiya, N. Attention and consciousness: Two distinct brain processes. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 11, 16-22, 2007] and possibly even orthogonal processes [Lamme, V. A. F. Why visual attention and awareness are different. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7, 12-18, 2003]. Attention and consciousness converge when conscious visual percepts are attended and hence become available for conscious report. In such a view, a lack of reportability can have two causes: the absence of attention or the absence of a conscious percept. This raises an important question in the field of perceptual learning. It is known that learning can occur in the absence of reportability [Gutnisky, D. A., Hansen, B. J., Iliescu, B. F., & Dragoi, V. Attention alters visual plasticity during exposure-based learning. Current Biology, 19, 555-560, 2009; Seitz, A. R., Kim, D., & Watanabe, T. Rewards evoke learning of unconsciously processed visual stimuli in adult humans. Neuron, 61, 700-707, 2009; Seitz, A.

Nature, 413, 844-848, 2001], but it is unclear which of the two ingredients-consciousness or attention-is not necessary for learning. We presented textured figure-ground stimuli and manipulated reportability either by masking (which only interferes with consciousness) or with an inattention paradigm (which only interferes with attention). During the second session (24 hr later), learning was assessed neurally and behaviorally, via differences in figure-ground ERPs and via a detection task. Behavioral and neural learning effects were found for stimuli presented in the inattention paradigm and not for masked stimuli. Interestingly, the behavioral learning effect only became apparent when performance feedback was given on the task to measure learning, suggesting that the memory trace that is formed during inattention is latent until accessed. The results suggest that learning requires consciousness, and not attention, and further strengthen the idea that consciousness is separate from attention.",1,0.6960849151623963,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.19608491516239634
39949384,Thyroid Storm Triggered by Rotavirus Infection in a 10-Year-Old Girl.,"We encountered a case of Graves' disease in a pediatric patient who presented with thyroid storm (TS), the onset of which was triggered by rotavirus infection. Rotavirus is commonly associated with severe watery diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and dehydration-particularly in infants and young children. In more severe cases, it can also lead to altered consciousness and seizures. These symptoms can resemble those of TS, even in the absence of pre-existing hyperthyroidism. In cases of hyperthyroidism, these symptoms confirm the criteria for TS. Therefore, it is possible that some cases of TS are triggered and caused by gastrointestinal conditions such as rotavirus infection. Our case highlights the need for further investigation into the potential triggering pathogens in patients with TS to better clarify details regarding the patient's status or disease pathogenesis.",0,0.30844504660231603,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.19155495339768397

24811038,Exogenous spatial precuing reliably modulates object processing but not object substitution masking.,"Object substitution masking (OSM) is used in behavioral and imaging studies to investigate processes associated with the formation of a conscious percept. Reportedly, OSM occurs only when visual attention is diffusely spread over a search display or focused away from the target location. Indeed, the presumed role of spatial attention is central to theoretical accounts of OSM and of visual processing more generally (Di Lollo, Enns, & Rensink, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General 129:481-507, 2000). We report a series of five experiments in which valid spatial precuing is shown to enhance the ability of participants to accurately report a target but, in most cases, without affecting OSM. In only one experiment (Experiment 5) was a significant effect of precuing observed on masking. This is in contrast to the reliable effect shown across all five experiments in which precuing improved overall performance. The results are convergent with recent findings from Argyropoulos, Gellatly, and Pilling (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance 39:646-661, 2013), which show that OSM is independent of the number of distractor items in a display. Our results demonstrate that OSM can operate independently of focal attention. Previous claims of the strong interrelationship between OSM and spatial attention are likely to have arisen from ceiling or floor artifacts that restricted measurable performance.",1,0.6834974054551637,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.1834974054551637

Due to overlapping symptoms, it can be misdiagnosed as other neurological disorders. Case presentation: A 68-year-old man was presented to the emergency department with an exacerbating decline in the level of consciousness and dysarthria over a 20-day period. On admission, the laboratory examinations revealed a low level of calcium and parathyroid hormone. Brain imaging findings showed bilateral calcifications in the basal ganglia, pulvinar region of the thalami, and dentate nuclei. In addition, a prolonged QTc interval on his electrocardiogram (ECG) indicated hypocalcemia. After receiving calcium gluconate 10%, the calcium level and QTc interval stabilized, and the patient's level of consciousness gradually improved. Conclusion: Fahr's syndrome due to hypoparathyroidism should be suspected in any patient with neurological symptoms and hypocalcemia. Hence, early identification and management of hypoparathyroidism can prevent progression of calcification and improve patients' quality of life and prognosis.",0,0.31730764763976305,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.18269235236023695

However, no self-reported measures have been proposed for patients experiencing altered conscious states during seizures. This study describes the development and validation of a new scale for the quantitative assessment of the level and content of ictal consciousness, the Ictal Consciousness Inventory (ICI). The ICI is a 20-item questionnaire generated on the basis of interviews with patients, literature review, and consultation with experts. It was tested on a sample of 110 patients attending three different epilepsy clinics in Northern Italy, who also completed standardized clinical scales. Standard psychometric methods were used to demonstrate that this scale satisfies criteria for acceptability, reliability, and validity.

Important risk factors have been described such as age, sex, hypertension (HT) and season of the year, among others. The objective is to investigate the demographic characteristics and possible risk factors in a population of Chilean patients. METHODS: This retrospective study was based on the analysis of 244 clinical records of patients diagnosed with aneurismal SAH who were discharged from the Instituto de Neurocirugia ASENJO in Santiago, Chile. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 49.85 years and the male:female ratio was 1:2.7. The signs and symptoms were not different between sexes; cephalea (85.7%) was predominant, followed by loss of consciousness, vomiting/nausea and meningeal signs. Risk factors included sex, age and HT. Concordant with other reports, the incidence of SAH was greatest in spring. CONCLUSIONS: The demographic characteristics and risk factors observed in patients with aneurismal SAH treated in ASENJO were comparable to those of other populations.

25339922,Isolating neural correlates of conscious perception from neural correlates of reporting one's perception.,"To isolate neural correlates of conscious perception (NCCs), a standard approach has been to contrast neural activity elicited by identical stimuli of which subjects are aware vs. unaware. Because conscious experience is private, determining whether a stimulus was consciously perceived requires subjective report: e.g., button-presses indicating detection, visibility ratings, verbal reports, etc. This reporting requirement introduces a methodological confound when attempting to isolate NCCs: The neural processes responsible for accessing and reporting one's percept are difficult to distinguish from those underlying the conscious percept itself. Here, we review recent attempts to circumvent this issue via a modified inattentional blindness paradigm (Pitts et al., 2012) and present new data from a backward masking experiment in which task-relevance and visual awareness were manipulated in a 2 x 2 crossed design. In agreement with our previous inattentional blindness results, stimuli that were consciously perceived yet not immediately accessed for report (aware, task-irrelevant condition) elicited a mid-latency posterior ERP negativity (~200-240 ms), while stimuli that were accessed for report (aware, task-relevant condition) elicited additional components including a robust P3b (~380-480 ms) subsequent to the mid-latency negativity. Overall, these results suggest that some of the NCCs identified in previous studies may be more closely linked with accessing and maintaining perceptual information for reporting purposes than with encoding the conscious percept itself. An open question is whether the remaining NCC candidate (the ERP negativity at 200-240 ms) reflects visual awareness or object-based attention.",1,0.6761662342312179,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.1761662342312179

After the second dose, he suffered from two episodes of loss of consciousness with seizures, therefore mefloquine was discontinued. During the flight back after full recovery, seizures reoccurred while he was on board, he was disembarked in Addis Ababa and then transferred to Nairobi. After repatriation to Italy, he experienced four other similar episodes. The patient was still on full dose anticonvulsant therapy one year and a half after, as any attempt at reduced dose was unsuccessful. Currently, three agents (mefloquine, atovaquone/proguanil, and doxycycline) are recommended for malaria chemoprophylaxis, with similar efficacy but different adverse event profiles, regimens, and prices. Considering that mefloquine is associated with a higher risk of neurologic and psychiatric adverse events than the alternative regimens, we suggest considering mefloquine as a second line choice after atovaquone/proguanil and doxycycline for short-term travelers.",0,0.32497132742001744,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.17502867257998256
17728046,Assessing the level of consciousness in children: a plea for the Glasgow Coma Motor subscore.,"AIM: The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is not always easy to score and its reliability has been questioned. In adults the GCS Motor score has proven a valuable alternative, as it is easier to assess yet shows similar predictive capacity for outcome. We wanted to test the non-inferiority of the Glasgow Coma Motor score GCS-M versus the Total score GCS-T for predicting outcome in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As part of the Flemish paediatric trauma registry (PENTA) we collected data on 96 consecutive children (0-18 years) with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury. Outcome was evaluated using a three level ordinal scale: [normal to mild disability, moderate to severe disability and death]. A number of proportional odds models were fitted for various choices of predictive variables (GCS-T, GCS-M, age, sex, and injury severity score ISS). For each model we calculated Somers'D(xy) rank correlation and NagelKerke's R(2)N index, both measures of the predictive performance of the model. RESULTS: All children had an injury to the brain that resulted in a hospital stay of more than 48h. Half of them had a ""best"" initial GCS of 15; 60%, a Motor score of 6. The median Injury Severity Score ISS was 16. Outcome was 'normal to mild' in 79 children, 'moderate to severe' in 7, and 'death' in 10. D(xy) values were 0.983 for the model with the Motor score and 0.972 for that with the total GCS, indicating excellent predictive performance for both. R(2)N indices were 0.862 and 0.813, respectively. Overall the difference between all models was small. CONCLUSION: The GCS Motor subscore was shown to have at least the same predictive ability for outcome as the total GCS. It is our opinion that the total GCS is unnecessarily complicated (especially in children). Using the Motor score alone will improve scoring compliance and statistical performance. We do not believe that the reduction in number of potential scores from 13 to 6 would decrease the descriptive capacity significantly, since clinical algorithms typically group values of the total GCS into five or fewer ranges.",0,0.32777196339460907,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.17222803660539093

A 74-year-old female patient was diagnosed with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in the right eye and planned to undergo vitrectomy under retrobulbar anesthesia. After the retrobulbar anesthesia in her right eye, she became unconscious and apneic. It was suggested that she had developed brainstem anesthesia. Assisted ventilation was initiated. Atropine 0.5 mg, epinephrine 1 mg, ephedrine 30 mg, and lipid emulsion were given. Five minutes later, her consciousness and breathing gradually returned, but with uncertain light perception in her right eye.

34573851,Not All Structure and Dynamics Are Equal.,"The hard problem of consciousness has been a perennially vexing issue for the study of consciousness, particularly in giving a scientific and naturalized account of phenomenal experience. At the heart of the hard problem is an often-overlooked argument, which is at the core of the hard problem, and that is the structure and dynamics (S&D) argument. In this essay, I will argue that we have good reason to suspect that the S&D argument given by David Chalmers rests on a limited conception of S&D properties, what in this essay I'm calling extrinsic structure and dynamics. I argue that if we take recent insights from the complexity sciences and from recent developments in Integrated Information Theory (IIT) of Consciousness, that we get a more nuanced picture of S&D, specifically, a class of properties I'm calling intrinsic structure and dynamics. This I think opens the door to a broader class of properties with which we might naturally and scientifically explain phenomenal experience, as well as the relationship between syntactic, semantic, and intrinsic notions of information. I argue that Chalmers' characterization of structure and dynamics in his S&D argument paints them with too broad a brush and fails to account for important nuances, especially when considering accounting for a system's intrinsic properties. Ultimately, my hope is to vindicate a certain species of explanation from the S&D argument, and by extension dissolve the hard problem of consciousness at its core, by showing that not all structure and dynamics are equal.",1,0.6721166733343573,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.17211667333435732

In this study, the subliminal stimulation was obtained by means of Backward Masking. Specifically, we analyzed the cardiac and electrodermal responses evoked by the unmasked and masked presentation of spider shapes in arachnophobic individuals. To evaluate whether unaware processing entails discrimination of physical features vs emotional significance, crabs, morphologically similar to the spiders but different for emotional significance, and squirrels, different in both shape and emotional content, were also employed. The response to unmasked spiders consisted of a typical defense response (sympathetic activation), while that to innocuous stimuli of an orienting response (moderate electrodermal and vagal activations). In the subliminal condition, the electrodermal response to masked spiders was greater than that to the other animals suggesting an early detection of emotional content rather than of physical characteristics. In contrast, cardiac responses to the masked stimuli did not show any differences as a function of valence. These findings suggest that individuals can appraise the emotional content of unconsciously perceived stimuli and react with an arousal response. However, subliminal emotional stimuli does not seem able to elicit the complete pattern of autonomic responses typical of the defense response.",1,0.6717485707378639,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.17174857073786387

Treatment options for patients may include antiepileptic medications, lifestyle modifications, or, in some cases, surgical intervention aimed at resecting the area of the brain responsible for seizure generation. Shunt malfunction can lead to seizures in cases of hydrocephalus; however, seizures triggered by stimulation of a specific brain area by the shunt catheter post-placement have not been reported. CASE: This case provides a compelling example of a seizure triggered by the stimulation of a foreign body in the ventricle.

All scales were equally sensitive to conscious knowledge. PDW, however, was affected by risk aversion, and both RAS and SDS applied different minimal criteria for rule awareness. CR seems to capture the largest range of consciousness, but failed to indicate unconscious knowledge with the guessing criterion. We close by discussing the theoretical implications of scale sensitivity and propose that CR's unique features enable (in conjunction with RAS and FOW) a finer assessment of subjective states of awareness.",1,0.663345146459883,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.16334514645988296
20950351,Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of three intravenous doses of yohimbine in the horse.,"Yohimbine is an alpha 2 adrenergic receptor antagonist, which has been shown to counteract the CNS depressant effects of alpha 2 receptor agonists in a number of species. Recently, our laboratory identified yohimbine in the absence of detectable concentrations of an alpha 2 agonist in a regulatory sample collected from a horse racing in California. This coupled with anecdotal reports of CNS stimulation and documented reports of cardiovascular changes when administered in conjunction with an agonist led us to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of yohimbine when administered alone. Nine healthy adult horses received a single intravenous dose of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/kg yohimbine. Blood samples were collected at time 0 (prior to drug administration) and at various times up to 24 h postdrug administration. Plasma samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and resulting data analyzed using both noncompartmental and compartmental analysis. Peak plasma concentrations were 106.0 +/- 28.9, 156.7 +/- 34.3, and 223.0 +/- 44.5 ng/mL for doses of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/kg, respectively. Immediately following administration, two horses showed signs of sedation, one horse appeared excited, while the other six appeared behaviorally unaffected. Episodes of tachycardia were noted within minutes of administration for all horses at all doses; however, there was no correlation between behavioral responses and episodes of increased heart rate. Sixty-three percent of the horses (8, 6, and 4 of the 9 horses in the 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/kg dose groups, respectively) exhibited second-degree atrial-ventricular conduction blocks and bradycardia prior to drug administration that transiently improved or disappeared upon administration of yohimbine. Gastrointestinal sounds were transiently increased following all doses.",0,0.3373918337740175,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.1626081662259825
11422456,Conscious recollection and illusory recognition: an event-related fMRI study.,"In this event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we examined the neuronal correlates of the subprocesses underlying recognition memory. In an explicit memory task, participants had to discriminate studied ('old') words from semantically related and unrelated 'new' (unstudied) words. We examined whether the correct rejection of semantically related words which were similar to old words, which had elicited correct responses, was based on conscious recollection of study phase information. In this task, false-positive responses to semantically related new words can be assumed to result from the assessment of the semantic similarity between test words and studied words with minimal recollection. For correct identification of old words and correct rejection of new related words we found common activation in a variety of brain areas that have been shown to be involved in conscious recollection, among them the left middle frontal gyrus, the precuneus, the retrosplenial cortex, the left parahippocampal gyrus and the thalamus. For correct responses to old words, the frontomedian wall, the posterior cingulate cortex and the nucleus accumbens were additionally activated, suggesting an emotional contribution to these judgements. Correct rejections of related new words were associated with additional activation of the right middle frontal gyrus, suggesting higher monitoring demands for these more difficult recognition judgements. False-positive responses to semantically related new words were associated with enhanced activation in the frontomedian wall. The results point to an important role of the prefrontal cortex as well as medial temporal and medial parietal regions of the brain in successful memory retrieval and conscious recollection.",1,0.6619148089085009,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.16191480890850085
38179033,A prospective study on single-port versus multiport patient-reported surgical outcomes.,"INTRODUCTION: We sought to determine potential patient reported advantages of the da Vinci single-port (SP) robotic system for urological procedures compared with the previous model, the da Vinci multiport (MP) system. The SP model utilizes a single 30 to 40 mm incision rather than multiple 5 to 22 mm incisions. This project aims to prospectively investigate the impact of the novel SP system on patient reported cosmetic and psychometric surgical outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of patients who underwent uro-oncologic surgery by three urologists at the University of Illinois Chicago from April to November 2021. Study participants completed a Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire 20 and 90 days post-procedure. The Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire is a reliable measure of surgical scars that includes five subscales: Appearance, Symptoms, Consciousness, Satisfaction with Appearance, and Satisfaction with Symptoms. Higher scores represented worse reported outcomes. RESULTS: On Postoperative Day 20, there were 77 responses (53 SP and 24 MP). Patients receiving SP procedures reported more favourable outcomes in terms of appearance, symptoms, consciousness, and pain medication. On Day 90, there were 37 responses (24 SP and 13 MP). Patients receiving SP procedures reported more favourable outcomes in terms of appearance. No significant differences were seen on Day 90 in terms of pain, medication, symptoms, consciousness, or satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the superiority of the SP in patient reported cosmetic and pain outcomes on short- and long-term follow-up after uro-oncological surgical procedures. Symptomatic and cosmetic advantages are present at the 20 day follow-up, with better scar appearance being significant 90 days after surgery.",0,0.33892057917315427,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.16107942082684573
40191062,Systemic Primary Carnitine Deficiency Presenting With Substantia Nigra and Basal Ganglia Injury: A Case Report.,"Systemic primary carnitine deficiency (SPCD) is a rare congenital fatty acid metabolism disorder causing impaired beta-oxidation and energy production, leading to hypoglycemia, metabolic encephalopathy, and sudden death. Early diagnosis and treatment, including L-carnitine supplementation and fasting avoidance, can improve prognosis. However, newborn screening (NBS) criteria differ by region, and standardized guidelines are lacking. This report presents a case of SPCD undetected by NBS, resulting in basal ganglia damage and dystonia due to metabolic decompensation. A 1-year-9-month-old girl with no abnormalities on NBS presented with impaired consciousness. She exhibited hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and myocardial hypertrophy. Suspecting a fatty acid metabolism disorder, L-carnitine and high-calorie infusion were initiated. Laboratory tests revealed markedly low serum total and free carnitine levels, and genetic analysis confirmed a homozygous SLC22A5 mutation. Brain MRI on day 7 revealed bilateral basal ganglia and substantia nigra abnormalities. The patient developed severe dystonia and respiratory failure, requiring ECMO management. L-DOPA was initiated on day 62, resulting in improvements in dystonia, swallowing, and motor function. By day 88, MRI showed resolution of basal ganglia abnormalities, though cerebral atrophy persisted. Basal ganglia damage is a rare but severe SPCD complication. L-DOPA may alleviate dystonia by acting on dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Early ketone measurement during emergencies is crucial for diagnosing fatty acid metabolism disorders. A standardized NBS protocol with a defined carnitine cutoff value is essential for early detection and prevention of SPCD complications.",0,0.34094900650558013,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.15905099349441987

Cardiac index (CI), stroke index (SI) and ejection fraction (EF) were measured by transthoracic electrical bioimpedance and, in the anaesthesia group, arterial and central venous blood samples were obtained to assess oxygen delivery (DO2), oxygen consumption (VO2) and oxygen extraction ratio (O2ER). In conscious patients, heart rate (HR) remained unchanged as SI, EF and CI increased. When haemodilution was performed during anaesthesia, CI remained stable in spite of a slight increase in SI, as HR decreased.

8257404,The role of CS-US contingency in human evaluative conditioning.,"Recent studies suggest that in Pavlovian conditioning, two different processes may be operative: signal learning and evaluative learning, resulting in two qualitatively different associative structures. Signal-learning is hypothesized to be responsible for providing us with genuine predictors (CS) for significant events (US). This proposition logically entails that the statistical-correlational relation, i.e. the contingency between CS and US should be a crucial determinant of signal learning. Evaluative conditioning, on the other hand, refers to the observation that the mere pairing of neutral with (dis)liked stimuli changes the valence of the originally neutral stimuli in a (negative) positive direction. As argued elsewhere, evaluative conditioning is probably based on the CS acquiring a mere referential value to the US, without any genuine CS-US expectancy being involved. From this, it was hypothesized that evaluative conditioning might not be dependent on CS-US contingency. Using the standard evaluative conditioning paradigm, four different levels of CS-US contingency were created on a between-subject base. The overall effect of evaluative conditioning was strongly significant, and was not mediated by awareness of the CS-US relation. Of crucial importance, this conditioning effect did not interact with the level of contingency, supporting the hypothesis that CS-US contingency is not a crucial determinant of evaluative conditioning. Moreover, this effect was obtained in a situation in which Ss simultaneously evidence to have consciously registered quite accurately the different levels of CS-US contingency.",0,0.3417393508849587,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.15826064911504129

RECENT FINDINGS: The fundamental distinction is between seizures that begin focally in one hemisphere of the brain, generalized onset seizures that apparently originate in both hemispheres, and seizures of unknown onset. Focal seizures optionally can be subclassified according to whether awareness (a surrogate marker for consciousness) is intact or impaired. The next level of classification for focal seizures is motor (with subgroups automatisms, atonic, clonic, epileptic spasms, hyperkinetic, myoclonic, tonic), non-motor (with subgroups autonomic, behavior arrest, cognitive, emotional, sensory), and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic. Generalized seizures are categorized as motor (tonic-clonic, clonic, tonic, myoclonic, myoclonic-tonic-clonic, myoclonic-atonic, atonic, epileptic spasms) and non-motor/absence (typical, atypical, myoclonic, eyelid myoclonia). The classification allows new types of focal seizures and a few new generalized seizures, and clarifies terms used to name seizures.",0,0.3422965344942579,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.1577034655057421
16484362,Enhanced sympathetic outflow and decreased baroreflex sensitivity are associated with intermittent hypoxia-induced systemic hypertension in conscious rats.,"Long-term exposure to intermittent hypoxia (IH), such as that occurring in association with sleep apnea, may result in systemic hypertension; however, the time course changes in arterial pressure, autonomic functions, and baroreflex sensitivity are still unclear. We investigated the changes in cardiovascular neural regulations during the development of chronic IH-induced hypertension in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to repetitive 1.25-min cycles (30 s of N2+45 s of 21% O2) of IH or room air (RA) for 6 h/day during light phase (10 AM-4 PM) for 30 days. Arterial pressure was measured daily using the telemetry system during RA breathing. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and interpulse interval (PPI) signals were then used to assess the autonomic functions and spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity by auto- and cross-spectral analysis, respectively. Stable MAP, low-frequency power of MAP (BLF), and low-frequency power (LF)-to-high frequency power (HF) ratio of PPI (LF/HF) were significantly higher in IH-exposed rats, compared with those of RA-exposed rats. Elevation of the MAP, BLF, LF/HF, and minute ventilation started 5 days after IH exposure and lasted until the end of the 30-day observation period. Additionally, IH-exposed rats had significant lower slope of MAP-PPI linear regression (under a successively descending and ascending) and magnitude of MAP-PPI transfer function (at frequency ranges of 0.06-0.6 Hz or 0.6-2.4 Hz) after IH exposure for 17 days. However, RA-exposed rats did not exhibit these changes. The results of this study indicate that chronic IH-induced hypertension is associated with a facilitation of cardiovascular sympathetic outflow and inhibition of baroreflex sensitivity in conscious rats.",0,0.34293087293988816,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.15706912706011184

31776211,"Level of Consciousness Is Dissociable from Electroencephalographic Measures of Cortical Connectivity, Slow Oscillations, and Complexity.","Leading neuroscientific theories posit a central role for the functional integration of cortical areas in conscious states. Considerable evidence supporting this hypothesis is based on network changes during anesthesia, but it is unclear whether these changes represent state-related (conscious vs unconscious) or drug-related (anesthetic vs no anesthetic) effects. We recently demonstrated that carbachol delivery to prefrontal cortex (PFC) restored wakefulness despite continuous administration of the general anesthetic sevoflurane. By contrast, carbachol delivery to parietal cortex, or noradrenaline delivery to either prefrontal or parietal cortices, failed to restore wakefulness. Thus, carbachol-induced reversal of sevoflurane anesthesia represents a unique state that combines wakefulness with clinically relevant anesthetic concentrations in the brain. To differentiate the state-related and drug-related associations of cortical connectivity and dynamics, we analyzed the electroencephalographic data gathered from adult male Sprague Dawley rats during the aforementioned experiments for changes in functional cortical gamma connectivity (25-155 Hz), slow oscillations (0.5-1 Hz), and complexity (<175 Hz). We show that higher gamma (85-155 Hz) connectivity is decreased (p </= 0.02) during sevoflurane anesthesia, an expected finding, but was not restored during wakefulness induced by carbachol delivery to PFC. Conversely, for rats in which wakefulness was not restored, the functional gamma connectivity remained reduced, but there was a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in the power of slow oscillations and increase (p < 0.001) in cortical complexity, which was similar to that observed during wakefulness induced after carbachol delivery to PFC. We conclude that the level of consciousness can be dissociated from cortical connectivity, oscillations, and dynamics.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Numerous theories of consciousness suggest that functional connectivity across the cortex is characteristic of the conscious state and is reduced during anesthesia. However, it is unknown whether the observed changes are state-related (conscious vs unconscious) or drug-related (drug vs no drug). We used a novel rat model in which cholinergic stimulation of PFC produced wakefulness despite continuous exposure to a general anesthetic. We demonstrate that, as expected, general anesthesia reduces connectivity. Surprisingly, the connectivity remains suppressed despite pharmacologically induced wakefulness in the presence of anesthetic, with restoration occurring only after the anesthetic is discontinued. Thus, whether an animal exhibits wakefulness or not can be dissociated from cortical connectivity, prompting a reevaluation of the role of connectivity in level of consciousness.",1,0.6467996571399242,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.14679965713992416
29973890,The Relevance of Explanatory First-Person Approaches (EFPA) for Understanding Psychopathological Phenomena. The Role of Phenomenology.,"The main aim of this paper is to demonstrate the contributions of phenomenology-inspired approaches to the explanation of psychopathological phenomena. First, I introduce the notion of Explanatory First-Person Approaches (EFPA) which share the assumption that the explanation of consciousness and conscious phenomena necessitates, at least partially, phenomenal facts functioning as explanans. Phenomenal facts refer to facts about structures and processes of consciousness. To differentiate phenomenology from other EFPA and to extract its distinctive feature, I compare phenomenology to the method falling under the category of EFPA it overlaps with the most: new introspective methods as recently described. I then present genetic phenomenology as the distinctive feature of phenomenology and show how particularly genetic phenomenology complements biological explanations of psychopathological phenomena in the context of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Moreover, I present Cognitive Theory (CT) as the most acknowledged EFPA in the broader scientific community, demonstrate CT's limitations in explaining conscious phenomena in the context of psychological disturbances such as depression, and show how genetic phenomenology can also significantly complement the cognitive approach. An example in the context of burnout-depression will be given. The overall argument for the significance of phenomenology is as follows: Genetic phenomenology renders phenomenology a distinctive kind of EFPA; genetic phenomenology can complement one of the most dominant non-EFPA accounts in the science of psychiatric disorders: biological reductionism; and genetic phenomenology can complement the most dominant existing EFPA in the science of psychological disturbances: Cognitive Theory.",1,0.6458502596076866,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.1458502596076866
25627861,Making sense: Dopamine activates conscious self-monitoring through medial prefrontal cortex.,"When experiences become meaningful to the self, they are linked to synchronous activity in a paralimbic network of self-awareness and dopaminergic activity. This network includes medial prefrontal and medial parietal/posterior cingulate cortices, where transcranial magnetic stimulation may transiently impair self-awareness. Conversely, we hypothesize that dopaminergic stimulation may improve self-awareness and metacognition (i.e., the ability of the brain to consciously monitor its own cognitive processes). Here, we demonstrate improved noetic (conscious) metacognition by oral administration of 100 mg dopamine in minimal self-awareness. In a separate experiment with extended self-awareness dopamine improved the retrieval accuracy of memories of self-judgment (autonoetic, i.e., explicitly self-conscious) metacognition. Concomitantly, magnetoencephalography (MEG) showed increased amplitudes of oscillations (power) preferentially in the medial prefrontal cortex. Given that electromagnetic activity in this region is instrumental in self-awareness, this explains the specific effect of dopamine on explicit self-awareness and autonoetic metacognition.",1,0.6333463224323775,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.13334632243237754

In this study, we explored whether responses can implicitly induce the use of cognitive control, especially in selecting and implementing task-sets. Participants were trained to perform tasks corresponding to different task cues during the training phase. Unbeknownst to participants, the response-contingent group's response to the previous trial determined task type in the subsequent trial, while that of the random group was randomly determined. When the task cue was removed in the testing phase, the percentage of correctly selected response-contingent tasks of the response-contingent group was at a greater level than the chance and the random group, implying that cueing by response can activate appropriate task-sets. The perceptual stimuli did not modulate the task cueing by response, and the response was directly associated with the task.

35475373,Naturalistic use of psychedelics is related to emotional reactivity and self-consciousness: The mediating role of ego-dissolution and mystical experiences.,"BACKGROUND: Psychedelics are able to acutely alter emotional reactivity and self-consciousness. However, whether the regular naturalistic use of psychedelics can be linked to more persistent trait-level changes in these domains remains an open question. AIM: To test the hypotheses that (1) using psychedelics is related to higher positive and lower negative emotional reactivity; and (2) an adaptive pattern of self-consciousness, including diminished public self-consciousness and rumination, and increased reflection and self-awareness; and (3) these relations are mediated by the intensity of past ego-dissolution and mystical experiences. METHOD: An online survey including questions about the history of psychoactive substance use; questionnaires measuring trait levels of emotional reactivity and self-consciousness; questionnaires for retrospective assessment of ego-dissolution and mystical experiences. Data collected from 2516 participants (1661 psychedelics users) were analyzed using robust linear regression and mediation analysis. RESULTS: A higher number of lifetime uses of psychedelics predicted greater positive and lower negative emotional reactivity; also, in the domain of self-consciousness, it predicted greater reflection and internal state awareness, and reduced rumination tendency and public self-consciousness. Finally, the intensity of past mystical and ego-dissolution experiences mediated almost all the observed relationships between the lifetime number of psychedelics uses and psychological variables. CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime psychedelics use predicts an adaptive pattern of trait-level emotional reactivity and self-consciousness. Ego-dissolution and mystical experiences are essential in understanding the long-lasting psychological effects of psychedelics use. Our findings might potentially explain previous observations of increased well-being in psychedelics users.",0,0.36995851452327316,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.13004148547672684

Relying chiefly upon documents located in Anglo-American archives, its argument follows a narrative from money to memory, and posits that this global community of neurologists formed not out of a shared science and medicine of the nervous system, but out of shared dispositions in tastes, values, and culture. The localism and heterogeneity of the science and medicine of the nervous system was in fact so pronounced that neurologists - especially when they worked as ""global citizens"" - were forced to focus upon their superficial commonalities rather than examine local distinctions. This avoidance of a direct effort to define the content of neurology - or at least to confront their differences - exercised a peculiar influence on the specialty. Neurologists and their ""official memory"" became negotiated, and even imagined constructs.

30770613,"Healthier rhythm, healthier brain? Integrity of circadian melatonin and temperature rhythms relates to the clinical state of brain-injured patients.","BACKGROUND: Healthy circadian rhythmicity has been suggested to relate to a better state of brain-injured patients and to support the emergence of consciousness in patient groups characterized by a relative instability thereof such as patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC). METHODS: Going beyond earlier studies, a systems-level perspective was adopted and, using multilevel modelling, the joint predictive value of three indices of circadian rhythm integrity derived from skin temperature variations, melatoninsulfate secretion, and physical activity (wrist actigraphy) patterns was evaluated for the behaviourally assessed state [Coma Recovery Scale - Revised (CRS-R) score] of DOC patients [13 unresponsive wakefulness syndrome; seven minimally conscious (exit) state]. Additionally, it was assessed in a subset of 16 patients whether patients' behavioural repertoire (CRS-R score) varied (i) with time of day or (ii) offset from the body temperature maximum (BT(max) ), i.e. when cognitive performance is expected to peak. RESULTS: The results reveal that better integrity of circadian melatoninsulfate and temperature rhythms relate to a richer behavioural repertoire. Moreover, higher CRS-R scores are, by trend, related to assessments taking place at a later daytime or deviating less from the pre-specified time of occurrence of BT(max) . CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the results suggest that therapeutic approaches aimed at improving circadian rhythms in brain-injured patients are promising and should be implemented in hospitals or nursing homes. Beyond this, it might be helpful to schedule diagnostic procedures and therapies around the (pre-assessed) BT(max) ( approximately 4 pm in healthy individuals) as this is when patients should be most responsive.",0,0.3711624237210349,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.12883757627896508
35617851,Neural mechanisms of response priming do not support veridical unconscious processing.,"Studies using the priming paradigm often infer that unconscious processes have more veridical access to the world than conscious processes. These interpretations are based on a standard reasoning that erroneously infers good sensitivity of indirect measures from a clear priming effect. To correct for this fallacy, researchers should explicitly compute the sensitivities from indirect measures and compare them against the sensitivities of direct measures. Recent results suggest that indirect behavioral measures are not more sensitive than direct measures and challenge interpretations about veridical unconscious processing. We add to these behavioral results by focusing on neurophysiological indirect measures. In two EEG experiments, we investigate whether event related potentials (ERPs) are more sensitive to different visual stimuli than direct measures. The results show the opposite effect: higher sensitivities for direct than indirect measures. Therefore-contrasting commonly held belief-we find no evidence for more veridical unconscious than conscious processes in ERP measures.",1,0.6280362557406248,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.12803625574062483

23178958,Conscious processing during retrieval can occur in early and late visual regions.,"Previous evidence has suggested a functional-anatomic dissociation between conscious and nonconscious processing during retrieval where early visual regions BA17/18 are associated with nonconscious processing and late visual regions BA19/37 are associated with conscious processing. However, evidence for this dissociation has only been observed using a limited number of experimental paradigms. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we tested the hypothesis that conscious processing during retrieval can occur in BA17/18 using memorial paradigms that recruited processing in these early visual regions. During the encoding phase of Experiment 1, abstract shapes with colored and oriented internal lines were presented to the left and right of fixation. During the retrieval phase, old shapes and new shapes were presented at fixation and participants classified each item as ""old-left"", ""old-right"", or ""new"". The contrast of spatial memory-hits>spatial memory-misses (with accurate item memory) produced activity in BA17/18. During the encoding phase of Experiment 2, abstract shapes with colored and oriented internal lines were presented at fixation. During the retrieval phase, old shapes, changed shapes (with the same outline but different colored and oriented internal lines), and new shapes were presented at fixation and participants made an old-new classification during runs with a specific retrieval orientation or a non-specific retrieval orientation. Critically, the contrast of old-hits>old-misses during specific retrieval orientation produced activity in BA17/18. The results of the present experiments support the hypothesis that conscious processing during retrieval can occur in BA17/18.",1,0.6142123974452052,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.11421239744520517
24057119,The delusion of the Master: the last days of Henry James.,"The novelist Henry James shared with his brother William, the author of the Principles of Psychology, a deep interest in the ways in which personal identity is built through one's history and experiences. At the end of his life, Henry James suffered a vascular stroke in the right hemisphere and developed a striking identity delusion. He dictated in a perfectly clear and coherent manner two letters as if they were written by Napoleon Bonaparte. He also showed signs of reduplicative paramnesia. Negative symptoms resulting from right hemisphere damage may disrupt the feelings of ""warmth and intimacy and immediacy"" and the ""resemblance among the parts of a continuum of feelings (especially bodily feelings)"", which are the foundation of personal identity according to William James. On the other hand, a left hemisphere receiving inadequate input from the damaged right hemisphere may produce positive symptoms such as delusional, confabulatory narratives. Other fragments dictated during Henry James's final disease reveal some form of insight, if partial and disintegrated, into his condition. Thus, even when consciousness is impaired by brain damage, something of its deep nature may persist, as attested by the literary characteristics of the last fragments of the Master.",1,0.6141720321554613,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.11417203215546134

(Phyllanthaceae), a native Brazilian tree occurring mainly in the Amazon, is used in folk medicine for the treatment of abscesses (bark) and cancer-like symptoms (leaves). The present study evaluates the safety of its acute oral administration and its effects on nociception and plasma leakage. The chemical constitution of the leaf's ethanolic extract is determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS. Its acute oral toxicity is evaluated in female rats at a dose of 2000 mg/kg, evaluating the occurrence of deaths and Hippocratic, behavioral, hematological, biochemical, and histopathological changes, as well as food and water consumption and weight gain. Antinociceptive activity is evaluated in male mice with acetic-acid-induced peritonitis (APT) and formalin (FT) tests. An open field (OF) test is performed to verify possible interferences in the animals' consciousness or locomotion. LC-MS analysis shows the presence of 44 compounds classified as phenolic acid derivatives, flavonoids and O-glycosylated derivatives, and hydrolyzable tannins. No deaths or significant behavioral, histological, or biochemical changes are observed in the toxicity assessment. In nociception tests, M. nobilis extract significantly reduces abdominal contortions in APT, demonstrating selectivity for inflammatory components (FT second phase), not interfering in neuropathic components (FT first phase) or consciousness and locomotion levels in OF. Additionally, M. nobilis extract inhibits plasma acetic-acid-induced leakage. These data demonstrate the low toxicity of M. nobilis ethanolic extract, as well as its effectiveness in modulating inflammatory nociception and plasma leakage, possibly related to the flavonoids and tannins present in its composition.",0,0.386803162551293,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.11319683744870701

This technique represents a valuable tool in studying the neuronal network activity underlying these behaviors. The article provides a detailed and complete procedure for electrode implantation and consequent extracellular recording in free-moving conscious mice. The study includes a detailed method for implanting the microelectrode arrays, capturing the LFP and neuronal spiking signals in the motor cortex (MC) using a multichannel system, and the subsequent offline data analysis. The advantage of multichannel recording in conscious animals is that a greater number of spiking neurons and neuronal subtypes can be obtained and compared, which allows the evaluation of the relationship between a specific behavior and the associated electrophysiological signals. Notably, the multichannel extracellular recording technique and the data analysis procedure described in the present study can be applied to other brain areas when conducting experiments in behaving mice.",0,0.38938536788259076,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.11061463211740924
35485099,[Not Available].,"According to Michel Foucault, French philosophy can be divided into two categories, one, the philosophy of consciousness, the other that of the concept. This dichotomy is linked to the terminology of Jean Cavailles in his work entitled ""On the logic and the theory of science"". (Cavailles J, PUF, 1947). In France, as this, there is a long tradition of epistemology whose project is to retrace the history of science by continuing the development of concepts that animate it and by analyzing their evolution. This tradition has long been interested in philosophy of medicine and biology. Its most important representative in this domain is Georges Canguilhem whose influence has spread widely. In this article, we will focus on one of the most representative of Canguilhem: <<The normal and the pathological>>. (Canguilhem G, PUF, 1966). The reading of Canguilhem that we will propose here, focusing on some key concepts of his book, highlights in this author three fundamental points: the impossibility of objectivable pathology, the central role of individuality and the preeminence of normativism. We are aware of limits of this reading, which cannot fundamentally explore all of Canguilhem's thought or the tradition of French vitalism. On the other hand, it should help us in our effort, in terms of building an epistemology of vertebrotherapy, by carefully analyzing Canguilhem's work and the notebooks of a great Japanese vertebrotherapist in Showa's time, Fujimori Sr.",1,0.6089721368261436,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.1089721368261436

The absence of the striate cortex was confirmed with anatomic and functional MRI and high-resolution EEG. His cortical visual impairment was severe, but he retained a remarkable ability to see fast-moving stimuli. Horizontal optokinetic nystagmus could be elicited from either eye. Resolution acuity was close to normal providing the patient was allowed to move his head and eyes. The direction of motion in random-dot patterns could be discriminated with perfect accuracy at speeds above 2 deg/s, and the patient reported that he could 'see' the motion at fast but not at slow speeds. This conscious residual vision for motion is known as Riddoch's phenomenon, but it has never been reported in the complete absence of the striate cortex. Functional neuroimaging revealed activation that was outside the motion-responsive regions of the extrastriate cortex.

7275491,Psychoanalytic interpretation and cognitive transformation.,"Psychoanalytic metapsychology should be recognized for what it is, namely a theory of cognition and affect that is not derived directly from clinical data but is advanced in order to provide the development background that will let us deal with the clinical findings of psychoanalysis as aberrations of and deviations from the normal and expected evolution of the thinking process. Its cornerstone is Freud's belief that thought depends on the forging of links between the sensory perception of objects and their appropriate verbal descriptions. He made no secret of his dissatisfaction with his metapsychology and repeatedly revised it in an attempt to encompass those clinical discoveries of psychoanalysis that outstripped the explanatory power of that metapsychology and demonstrated its shortcomings. Using what we now know about normal development in infancy and childhood through the work of Piaget, Vygotsky and other investigators, it is possible to formulate an explanatory theory that does justice to the varied and complex findings uncovered by the application of the psychoanalytic method. For example, the significance of Freud's postulated second censorship between the preconscious and consciousness, as well as the importance of the defence of disavowal that Freud emphasized in his writings after 1927, can now be accounted for with a theory of thought formation that was not available to the founder of psychoanalysis. The implications of this proposed reformulation for psychoanalytic interpretation and for the application of psychoanalysis to an increasingly wide range of psychopathology is discussed in some detail.",0,0.39464300486054127,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.10535699513945873

Moreover, much remains to be elucidated about its clinical course, and outcome. This is the first report of NCSE associated with the progression of a metastatic brain tumor treated by surgical excision of the tumor. The patient was 74-year-old woman. She had a history of craniotomy for tumor resection and gamma knife treatment for multiple metastatic brain tumors originating from breast cancer. She suddenly developed dysarthria and right hemiparesis, followed by convulsive seizures in the right side of her body. Magnetic resonance imaging showed tumor recurrence in the left parietal lobe and worsening edematous changes around the tumor. Antiseizure medication was initiated, however her seizures did not improve; therefore, tumor resection was performed. Postoperatively, her consciousness, seizures, and electroencephalogram findings improved. NCSE caused by brain tumors may be refractory to treatment with antiseizure medications, and early surgical treatment may be useful for seizure control.",0,0.39928700948009604,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.10071299051990396

Our aims were to determine if the route of intravenous glucose delivery also plays a role in regulating NHGU in the presence of hyperinsulinemia and to determine if length of fast (18 vs. 36 h) influences regulation of NHGU. Five conscious dogs fasted 18 h were given somatostatin and replacement insulin (245 +/- 34 microU.kg-1.min-1) and glucagon (0.65 ng.kg-1.min-1) infusions intraportally. After a 40-min control period, the insulin infusion rate was increased fourfold, and glucose was infused for 3 h. Glucose was given either through a peripheral vein or the portal vein for 90 min to double the glucose load reaching the liver. The order of infusions was randomized. NHGU was measured with the arterial - venous difference technique. Insulin and glucagon levels were 12 +/- 2, 35 +/- 6, and 36 +/- 5 microU/ml and 55 +/- 12, 61 +/- 13, and 59 +/- 7 pg/ml during the control, peripheral, and portal infusions, respectively.

The aim of this study was to compare the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) with individualised quantitative behavioural assessments (IQBA) to determine which method is capable of detecting command-following earlier and more consistently in persons with disorders of consciousness (DoC). Data from 27 patients with DoC, who underwent both assessments concurrently during inpatient rehabilitation, were retrospectively analysed. For each person, performance trajectories on the CRS-R auditory subscale item and IQBA dual command protocols were graphed together to identify earlier and more consistent evidence of consciousness; grouped data were analysed statistically. For 22 patients, IQBA more consistently documented consciousness than the CRS-R, whereas no patients showed the reverse pattern. For 14 of 20 analysable patients, IQBA provided earlier evidence of consciousness, for two patients CRS-R provided earlier evidence, and for four patients both methods provided initial evidence on the same day. These findings suggest that IQBA approaches can provide more consistent and earlier evidence of command-following than the comparable item on the CRS-R.

METHODS: Remifentanil and alfentanil were administered intravenously over 2 min in ascending doses (remifentanil 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20 microg/kg; alfentanil 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 160, 200 microg/kg) to unpremedicated healthy patients. Patients were observed for rigidity and LOC for 30 s after the end of infusion. If patients had not lost consciousness, 2 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) thiopental was administered until LOC was achieved. Arterial blood samples, obtained at specified time intervals, were analyzed for remifentanil and alfentanil whole-blood concentration. Blood pressure and heart rate were also recorded at preset time intervals. RESULTS: Neither drug could reliably produce LOC. With both drugs, there was a dose-dependent decrease in thiopental requirements and a dose-dependent increase in the incidence and severity of rigidity (P < 0.05). The median effective dose (ED50) for LOC with remifentanil was 12 microg/kg, and for alfentanil it was 176 mcrog/kg. The median effective concentration (EC50; whole-blood concentration) of remifentanil was 53.8 ng/ml and for alfentanil it was 1,012 ng/ml. Minimal hemodynamic changes were observed after either drug was given. CONCLUSIONS: Remifentanil is 15 times more potent than alfentanil, based on the ED50 to achieve loss of response to a verbal command and 20 times more potent than alfentanil based on the EC50.

Here I review psychological, neuroscience, and philosophical literature to reveal how perceptual metacognition possesses five unique properties that provide a powerful opportunity for studying the neural and computational correlates of subjective experience: (1) Metacognition leads to subjective experiences (we ""feel"" confident); (2) Metacognition is ""about"" internal representations, formalizing introspection; (3) Metacognitive computations are ""recursive"" (applying to meta-cognition and meta-meta-cognition), so we might discover ""canonical computations"" preserved across processing levels and implementations; (4) Metacognition is anchored to observable behavior; and (5) Metacognitive computations are unobservable yet hierarchically dependent, requiring development of sensitive, specific models. Given these properties, computational models of metacognition provide an empirically-tractable early step in characterizing the generative process that constructs qualitative experience. I also present practical ways to make progress in this vein, applying decades of developments in nearby fields to perceptual metacognition to reveal new and exciting insights about how the brain constructs subjective conscious experiences.",1,0.5501326568281092,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.05013265682810919

DESIGN: Systematic review of empirical research in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane from January 2002 to March 2016. MAIN MEASURES: Data extracted included sample size, type of electrophysiological technique and task design, rate of cognitive responders, false negatives and positives, and excluded subjects from the study analysis. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) was used for quality appraisal of the retrieved literature. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies examining electrophysiological signs of command-following in patients with DoC were identified. Sensitivity rates in healthy controls demonstrated variable accuracy across the studies, ranging from 71% to 100%. In patients with DoC, specificity and sensitivity rates varied in the included studies, ranging from 0% to 100%. Pronounced heterogeneity was found between studies regarding methodological approaches, task design, and procedures of analysis, rendering comparison between studies challenging.

19750398,Beauty and belief: William James and the aesthetics of delusions in schizophrenia.,"INTRODUCTION: This paper proposes the hypothesis that aesthetics plays an important role in the construction and maintenance of delusional ideas in schizophrenia. METHOD: A selective review of the literature on the cognitive science of aesthetics, beginning with the work of William James on the stream of thought, was undertaken together with a review of some of the cognitive neuroscience literature on delusion formation in schizophrenia. RESULTS: It is suggested that delusion formation has some similarities to to the creative process, but commences with a proto-psychotic anomalous experience in which an aberrant Jamesian fringe experience is generated. The consequence of such deviation from standard or expected conscious experience is to direct processing resources in a search for meaning, but under conditions of reduced prefrontal cortex monitoring and control mechanisms. Lowering of the usual constraints exercised by prefrontal cortex regulatory mechanisms causes the search for explanation or interpretation to be characterised by low self-reflection, temporal distortion and low volitional control, permitting relatively unfiltered ideas that do not conform to convention to emerge in consciousness. The combination of aberrant Jamesian fringe experience and reduced prefrontal regulatory mechanisms evoke idiosyncratic contextual associations and drive a hypersensitive salience assignment system in the search for meaning, out of which process nascent delusional beliefs emerge. These are accompanied by a 'sense of rightness' in the Jamesian fringe which signals the presence of a 'good fit' between the proto-psychotic anomalous experience in the centre of consciousness and the contextual associations evoked. CONCLUSION: The 'sense of rightness' or 'good fit' is responsible for the aesthetic qualities of the delusion and, it is proposed, accounts for the incorrigibility of the delusions.",0,0.47616996910860016,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.023830030891399845
28471243,Utility of providing a concussion definition in the assessment of concussion history in former NFL players.,"OBJECTIVE: Former National Football League (NFL) players' working knowledge of concussion has not yet been evaluated, despite this population being a major clinical research target due to the association between repetitive head impacts (RHI) and long-term clinical impairments. This study examined former NFL players' understanding of the current concussion definition, and the association between number of concussions with clinical function. METHODS: 95 former NFL players (mean age = 55.29; mean NFL year = 8.10) self-reported number of concussions before being provided with a concussion definition and after being read a modern definition of concussion. Subjects reported number of concussions with loss of consciousness (LOC). Principal Component Analysis of a battery of tests generated behaviour/mood, psychomotor speed/executive function, and verbal and visual memory factor scores. RESULTS: Post-definition number of concussions (median = 50) was five times the pre-definition (median = 10; p < 0.001). Greater pre- (p = 0.019) and post-definition concussions (p = 0.036) correlated with worse behaviour/mood scores, after controlling for years of football played, with specific effects for depressive symptoms and impulsivity. LOC did not account for variance beyond number of concussions. CONCLUSIONS: Practitioners and clinical researchers should provide a definition of concussion in the assessment of concussion history in former football players to facilitate accuracy and standardization.",0,0.47817231507142544,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.021827684928574564

20369490,[Monitoring depth of anesthesia: a comparision between electroencephalographic nonlinear index and bispectral index].,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficiency and accuracy of electroencephalographic nonlinear index (ENI) and bispectral index (BIS) in monitoring depth of anesthesia during general anesthesia. METHODS: Thirty patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery were recruited. The ability of ENI and BIS to distinguish between the anesthetic states (awake, loss of eyelash reflex, loss of response, steady anesthesia, first reaction and extubation) was analyzed with prediction probability (Pk). Correlation between ENI and BIS was tested by nonparametric Spearman rank correlation analysis, with data paired from awake through to extubation. The clinical performances of ENI and BIS were evaluated with success rate, responsiveness, and recovery time. RESULTS: ENI and BIS were better than mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) for distinguishing between the states of anesthesia. ENI correlated strongly with BIS from the stage of awake through to extubation (r = 0.93). No differences were found between ENI and BIS in success rate and responsiveness; but the recovery time was shorter with ENI than with BIS. CONCLUSION: ENI and BIS provide similar information reflecting the states of anesthesia, which allows accurate distinguishment between different states of anesthesia. The clinical performance of ENI is better than that of BIS.",0,0.4834812774907537,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.016518722509246297
35217645,Quantifying arousal and awareness in altered states of consciousness using interpretable deep learning.,"Consciousness can be defined by two components: arousal (wakefulness) and awareness (subjective experience). However, neurophysiological consciousness metrics able to disentangle between these components have not been reported. Here, we propose an explainable consciousness indicator (ECI) using deep learning to disentangle the components of consciousness. We employ electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation under various conditions, including sleep (n = 6), general anesthesia (n = 16), and severe brain injury (n = 34). We also test our framework using resting-state EEG under general anesthesia (n = 15) and severe brain injury (n = 34). ECI simultaneously quantifies arousal and awareness under physiological, pharmacological, and pathological conditions. Particularly, ketamine-induced anesthesia and rapid eye movement sleep with low arousal and high awareness are clearly distinguished from other states. In addition, parietal regions appear most relevant for quantifying arousal and awareness. This indicator provides insights into the neural correlates of altered states of consciousness.",1,0.5082014604741713,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.008201460474171252

A30-year known hypertensive male presented to the emergency department of Shalamar Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan, with altered state of consciousness. He had been in his usual state of health a day before the presentation. On examination he was afebrile, his GCS was 3/15 having pinpoint pupils with absent doll's eye movements. His blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, pulse rate was 62/minute, and respiratory rate was 10/minute. His right plantar was upgoing. He was resuscitated in emergency and was placed on ventilator due to hypoxemia. Computed tomography (CT) of brain revealed bilateral internal capsule hypolucencies and bilateral frontal lobe infarction. His urinary toxicological screening revealed extremely high concentrations of opioids and benzodiazepine.

33928517,"The Emotions in Cultural-Historical Activity Theory: Personality, Emotion and Motivation in Social Relations and Activity.","This article conceptualizes human emotion as formed within the cultural and historical development of each individual within their society, using theories of emotion created within cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT). It examines how the process of the cultural formation of emotion takes place as part of the social development of the personality, intimately tied in with motivation, need and desire. In doing this I review ideas about emotion in the work of the two founding thinkers of cultural-historical activity theory, L. S. Vygotsky and A. N. Leontyev; however, for different reasons their work has its limits in creating a contemporary understanding of emotion. Moving forward, I draw on more recent work on emotions in the field of CHAT, as well as on the work of M. M. Bakhtin, to create a more embodied understanding of the cultural-historical formation of the emotions as part of the dynamics of personality as a whole, including its conscious and unconscious elements.",0,0.49606524125293755,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,0.00393475874706245

36280263,Seeing Social: A Neural Signature for Conscious Perception of Social Interactions.,"Social information is some of the most ambiguous content we encounter in our daily lives, yet in experimental contexts, percepts of social interactions-that is, whether an interaction is present and if so, the nature of that interaction-are often dichotomized as correct or incorrect based on experimenter-assigned labels. Here, we investigated the behavioral and neural correlates of subjective (or conscious) social perception using data from the Human Connectome Project in which participants (n = 1049; 486 men, 562 women) viewed animations of geometric shapes during fMRI and indicated whether they perceived a social interaction or random motion. Critically, rather than experimenter-assigned labels, we used observers' own reports of ""Social"" or ""Non-social"" to classify percepts and characterize brain activity, including leveraging a particularly ambiguous animation perceived as ""Social"" by some but ""Non-social"" by others to control for visual input. Behaviorally, observers were biased toward perceiving information as social (vs non-social); and neurally, observer reports (compared with experimenter labels) explained more variance in activity across much of the brain. Using ""Unsure"" reports, we identified several regions that responded parametrically to perceived socialness. Neural responses to social versus non-social content diverged early in time and in the cortical hierarchy. Finally, individuals with higher internalizing trait scores showed both a higher response bias toward ""Social"" and an inverse relationship with activity in default mode and visual association areas while scanning for social information. Findings underscore the subjective nature of social perception and the importance of using observer reports to study percepts of social interactions.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Simple animations involving two or more geometric shapes have been used as a gold standard to understand social cognition and impairments therein. Yet, experimenter-assigned labels of what is social versus non-social are frequently used as a ground truth, despite the fact that percepts of such ambiguous social stimuli are highly subjective. Here, we used behavioral and fMRI data from a large sample of neurotypical individuals to show that participants' responses reveal subtle behavioral biases, help us study neural responses to social content more precisely, and covary with internalizing trait scores. Our findings underscore the subjective nature of social perception and the importance of considering observer reports in studying behavioral and neural dynamics of social perception.",1,0.501262532460132,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,False,0.001262532460131971
