8270321,Clinical and medicolegal aspects of conscious awareness during anesthesia.,"In summary, regarding the legal aspects of awareness during anesthesia, the questions for the court to answer are: Was the patient aware? If probably yes, did the anesthesia technique cause or materially contribute to the awareness? Alternatively, if res ipsa loquitur applies, can the anesthesiologist show that the technique was not negligent, if necessary by showing that it would have been acceptable to at least a responsible minority of practitioners? It will be clear from the foregoing that good recordkeeping cannot be overemphasized. Apart from the fact that a precise and clear record tends to convince the court that they are dealing with a careful practitioner, the most important factor is that the more you have recorded about the anesthesia course, the more you will be able to tell the court about it. Finally, if you are unfortunate enough to lose and the patient is awarded damages, how much will the patient get? In the United Kingdom recently, $20,000 was awarded to patients for awareness in orthopedic and obstetric cases--perhaps a modest amount by U.S. standards. If the patient develops posttraumatic stress disorder, a much larger award is likely, especially if the patient is unable to work as a result of it; loss of earnings always increases an award, and it could easily reach $750,000 for a big earner. Insurance or other indemnity should cover this, of course, but it pays to remember one's likely exposure to risk in the event of failing to pay one's premium.",0,0.7356713013719170,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,TRUE,0.2356713013719170

38789261,Transient Attention Gates Access Consciousness: Coupling N2pc and P3 Latencies Using Dynamic Time Warping.,"The N2pc and P3 event-related potentials (ERPs), used to index selective attention and access to working memory and conscious awareness, respectively, have been important tools in cognitive sciences. Although it is likely that these two components and the underlying cognitive processes are temporally and functionally linked, such links have not yet been convincingly demonstrated. Adopting a novel methodological approach based on dynamic time warping (DTW), we provide evidence that the N2pc and P3 ERP components are temporally linked. We analyzed data from an experiment where 23 participants (16 women) monitored bilateral rapid serial streams of letters and digits in order to report a target digit indicated by a shape cue, separately for trials with correct responses and trials where a temporally proximal distractor was reported instead (distractor intrusion). DTW analyses revealed that N2pc and P3 latencies were correlated in time, both when the target or a distractor was reported. Notably, this link was weaker on distractor intrusion trials. This N2pc-P3 association is discussed with respect to the relationship between attention and access consciousness. Our results demonstrate that our novel method provides a valuable approach for assessing temporal links between two cognitive processes and their underlying modulating factors. This method allows to establish links and their modulator for any two time-series across all domains of the field (general-purpose MATLAB functions and a Python module are provided alongside this paper).",1,0.31392537858955200,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,TRUE,0.18607462141044800
19818891,"How can we know if patients in coma, vegetative state or minimally conscious state are conscious?","This paper examines the claim that patients in coma, vegetative state and minimally conscious state may in fact be conscious. The topic is of great importance for a number of reasons--not least ethical. As soon as we know a given creature has any experiences at all, our ethical attitude towards it changes completely. A number of recent experiments looking for signs of intact or partially intact cognitive processing in the various stages of decreased level of consciousness are reviewed. Whether or not vegetative or coma patients are in fact conscious is an empirical issue that we yet do not know how to resolve. However, the simple fact that this is an unresolved empirical issue implies that the standard behavioural assessment is not sufficient to decide what it is like to be these patients. In other words, different and more sophisticated methods are necessary. From a theoretical position, the paper moves on to discuss differences in validity between reports (e.g. verbal) and signals (e.g. brain activations) in the study of consciousness, and whether results from experiments on the contents of consciousness may be of any use in the study of levels of consciousness. Finally, an integrated approach is suggested, which does not separate research in level and content as clearly as in current practice, and which may show a path to improved paradigms to determine whether patients in coma or vegetative state are conscious.",0,0.6752968863672780,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,TRUE,0.17529688636727800
19818912,Life can be worth living in locked-in syndrome.,"The locked-in syndrome (LIS) describes patients who are awake and conscious but severely deefferented leaving the patient in a state of almost complete immobility and loss of verbal communication. The etiology ranges from acute (e.g., brainstem stroke, which is the most frequent cause of LIS) to chronic causes (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ALS). In this article we review and present new data on the psychosocial adjustment to LIS. We refer to quality of life (QoL) and the degree of depressive symptoms as a measure of psychosocial adjustment. Various studies suggest that despite their extreme motor impairment, a significant number of LIS patients maintain a good QoL that seems unrelated to their state of physical functioning. Likewise, depression is not predicted by the physical state of the patients. A successful psychological adjustment to the disease was shown to be related to problem-oriented coping strategies, like seeking for information, and emotional coping strategies like denial--the latter may, nevertheless, vary with disease stage. Perceived social support seems to be the strongest predictor of psychosocial adjustment. QoL in LIS patients is often in the same range as in age-matched healthy individuals. Interestingly, there is evidence that significant others, like primary caregivers or spouses, rate LIS patients' QoL significantly lower than the patients themselves. With regard to depressed mood, ALS patients without symptoms focus significantly more often on internal factors that can be retained in the course of the disease contrary to patients with depressive symptoms who preferably name external factors as very important, such as health, which will degrade in the course of the disease. Typically, ALS patients with a higher degree of depressive symptoms experience significantly less ""very pleasant"" situations. The herein presented data strongly question the assumption among doctors, health-care workers, lay persons, and politicians that severe motor disability necessarily is intolerable and leads to end-of-life decisions or euthanasia. Existing evidence supports that biased clinicians provide less-aggressive medical treatment in LIS patients. Thus, psychological treatment for depression, effective strategies for coping with the disease, and support concerning the maintenance of the social network are needed to cope with the disease. Novel communication devices and assistive technology now offers an increasing number of LIS patients to resume a meaningful life and an active role in society.",0,0.6667605957397130,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,TRUE,0.16676059573971300

Are conscious and unconscious elaborations of emotional facial stimuli qualitatively different processes? In Experiment 1, ERPs elicited by supraliminal stimuli were recorded when 21 participants viewed emotional facial expressions of four emotions and a neutral stimulus. Two ERP components (N2 and P3) were analyzed for their peak amplitude and latency measures. First, emotional face-specificity was observed for the negative deflection N2, whereas P3 was not affected by the content of the stimulus (emotional or neutral). A more posterior distribution of ERPs was found for N2. Moreover, a lateralization effect was revealed for negative (right lateralization) and positive (left lateralization) facial expressions. In Experiment 2 (20 participants), 1-ms subliminal stimulation was carried out. Unaware information processing was revealed to be quite similar to aware information processing for peak amplitude but not for latency.

31059425,Novel Signal Processing Technique for Capture and Isolation of Blink-Related Oscillations Using a Low-Density Electrode Array for Bedside Evaluation of Consciousness.,"OBJECTIVE: Blink-related oscillations derived from electroencephalography (EEG) have recently emerged as an important measure of awareness. Combined with portable EEG hardware with low-density electrode arrays, this neural marker may crucially augment the existing bedside assessments of consciousness in unresponsive patients. Nonetheless, the close relationship between signal characteristics of the neural response of interest and blink-induced oculomotor artifacts poses particular challenges when measuring blink-related oscillations using a point-of-care platform. This study presents a novel denoising approach based on time-frequency (TF) filtering that exploits the differential temporal and spectral features to isolate the neural response from ocular artifact in a low-density array. METHODS: We investigated the effectiveness of the TF filtering technique using 64-channel EEG data collected in healthy adults, with focal analysis of the Pz and POz channels. RESULTS: TF filtering showed comparable performance in denoising the signal relative to the established gold-standard independent component analysis approach, with strong similarities in morphological characteristics as measured by intraclass correlations (p < 0.001), extent of artifact rejection based on the ocular contamination index (p < 0.006), as well as time- and frequency-domain signal capture (p < 0.05). Results are robust at the individual and group levels, and are crucially validated using raw data from only four electrodes comprising Pz, POz, Fp2, and T7. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate for the first time that TF filtering enables the successful capture and isolation of the blink-related oscillations response using a four-electrode array. SIGNIFICANCE: This significantly advances the translation of the blink-related oscillations marker to a point-of-care platform for eventual bedside applications.",0,0.6304992139834740,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,TRUE,0.1304992139834740

19059583,On the signals underlying conscious awareness of action.,"To investigate whether conscious judgments of movement onset are based solely on pre-movement signals (i.e., premotor or efference copy signals) or whether sensory feedback (i.e., reafferent) signals also play a role, participants judged the onset of finger and toe movements that were either active (i.e., self initiated) or passive (i.e., initiated by the experimenter). Conscious judgments were made by reporting the position of a rotating clock hand presented on a computer screen and were then compared to the actual measured time of movement onset. In line with previous studies, judgment errors were found to be anticipatory for both finger and toe movements. There was a significant difference between judgment errors for active and passive movements, with judgments of active movements being more anticipatory than judgments of passive movements. This is consistent with a pre-movement (from here on referred to as an ""efferent"") account of action awareness because premotor and efference copy signals are only present in active movements, whereas the main source of movement information in passive movements is sensory feedback which is subject to time delays of conduction (and hence predicts later judgment times for passive movements). However, judgments of active toe movement onset time were less anticipatory than judgments of active finger movement onset time. This pattern of results is not consistent with a pure efferent account of conscious awareness of action onset - as this account predicts more anticipatory judgments for toe movements compared to finger movements. Instead, the data support the idea that conscious judgments of movement onset are based on efferent (i.e., premotor, efference copy) and reafferent (i.e., feedback from the movement) components.",0,0.6187454213296200,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,TRUE,0.11874542132962000

PARTICIPANTS: Eleven volunteers (5 women; 23.40 (SD 2.09) years; BMI: 23.24 (SD 2.19)) who lacked previous experience with LCG and cold exposure experiments. RESULTS: Despite variations in core and skin temperatures, thermal comfort, thermal sensation, and mean body temperature did not fluctuate significantly over time. Participants were able to find a desired level of LCG inlet temperature within 25 minutes which was maintained at similar levels until the 65th minute of the cold exposure. During exercise, LCG inlet water temperature decreased significantly. Regression models demonstrated that mean skin temperature and change in mean body temperature were significantly associated with thermal comfort and thermal sensation. Subsequent models revealed that, although all temperature variables were associated with LCG inlet water temperature, the coefficient of determination mainly depended on mean skin temperature and change in mean body temperature. The involvement of skin temperature was anticipated as the liquid conditioning garment was in contact with the skin. CONCLUSIONS: Humans generate conscious thermoregulatory responses in resting and exercise conditions during exposures to cold environments that are aimed towards maintaining a threshold mean body temperature, rather than temperature changes in individual body regions.",0,0.5741671609048100,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,TRUE,0.0741671609048099

Understanding the role of ""consciousness"" as a resolution device, with specific focus on chemosensation and the olfactory system, is of appeal.

28124464,Patients' experience of thirst while being conscious and mechanically ventilated in the intensive care unit.,"BACKGROUND: Because of changes in sedation strategies, more patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are conscious. Therefore, new and challenging tasks in nursing practice have emerged, which require a focus on the problems that patients experience. Thirst is one such major problem, arising because the mechanical ventilator prevents the patients from drinking when they have the urge to do so. To gain a deeper understanding of the patients' experiences and to contribute new knowledge in nursing care, this study focuses on the patients' experiences of thirst during mechanical ventilation (MV) while being conscious. AIMS: To explore patients' experience of thirst while being conscious and mechanically ventilated. DESIGN: This hermeneutic study used qualitative interviews of 12 patients. METHOD: Data were analyzed based on content analysis. Interviews were conducted between September and October 2014 in two large ICUs in Denmark. RESULT: Four themes relating to the patients' experiences of thirst during MV were identified: a paramount thirst, a different sense in the mouth, deprivation of the opportunity to quench thirst and difficulties associated with thirst. CONCLUSION: Patients associate feelings of desperation, anxiety and powerlessness with the experience of thirst. These feelings have a negative impact on their psychological well-being. A strategy in the ICU that includes no sedation for critically ill patients in need of MV introduces new demands on the nurses who must care for patients who are struggling with thirst. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study shows that despite several practical attempts to relieve thirst, it remains a paramount problem for the patients. ICU nurses need to increase their focus on issues of thirst and dry mouth, which are two closely related issues for the patients. Communication may be a way to involve the patients, recognize and draw attention to their problem.",0,0.5444564872698730,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,TRUE,0.044456487269872800

METHODS: Thirty patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery were recruited. The ability of ENI and BIS to distinguish between the anesthetic states (awake, loss of eyelash reflex, loss of response, steady anesthesia, first reaction and extubation) was analyzed with prediction probability (Pk). Correlation between ENI and BIS was tested by nonparametric Spearman rank correlation analysis, with data paired from awake through to extubation. The clinical performances of ENI and BIS were evaluated with success rate, responsiveness, and recovery time. RESULTS: ENI and BIS were better than mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) for distinguishing between the states of anesthesia. ENI correlated strongly with BIS from the stage of awake through to extubation (r = 0.93). No differences were found between ENI and BIS in success rate and responsiveness; but the recovery time was shorter with ENI than with BIS. CONCLUSION: ENI and BIS provide similar information reflecting the states of anesthesia, which allows accurate distinguishment between different states of anesthesia. The clinical performance of ENI is better than that of BIS.",0,0.5380046788612920,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,TRUE,0.03800467886129220

In both cases, mental status changed, passing through three distinct stages: restlessness and insomnia, hallucinatory paranoid state, and disturbance of consciousness.

19750398,Beauty and belief: William James and the aesthetics of delusions in schizophrenia.,"INTRODUCTION: This paper proposes the hypothesis that aesthetics plays an important role in the construction and maintenance of delusional ideas in schizophrenia. METHOD: A selective review of the literature on the cognitive science of aesthetics, beginning with the work of William James on the stream of thought, was undertaken together with a review of some of the cognitive neuroscience literature on delusion formation in schizophrenia. RESULTS: It is suggested that delusion formation has some similarities to to the creative process, but commences with a proto-psychotic anomalous experience in which an aberrant Jamesian fringe experience is generated. The consequence of such deviation from standard or expected conscious experience is to direct processing resources in a search for meaning, but under conditions of reduced prefrontal cortex monitoring and control mechanisms. Lowering of the usual constraints exercised by prefrontal cortex regulatory mechanisms causes the search for explanation or interpretation to be characterised by low self-reflection, temporal distortion and low volitional control, permitting relatively unfiltered ideas that do not conform to convention to emerge in consciousness. The combination of aberrant Jamesian fringe experience and reduced prefrontal regulatory mechanisms evoke idiosyncratic contextual associations and drive a hypersensitive salience assignment system in the search for meaning, out of which process nascent delusional beliefs emerge. These are accompanied by a 'sense of rightness' in the Jamesian fringe which signals the presence of a 'good fit' between the proto-psychotic anomalous experience in the centre of consciousness and the contextual associations evoked. CONCLUSION: The 'sense of rightness' or 'good fit' is responsible for the aesthetic qualities of the delusion and, it is proposed, accounts for the incorrigibility of the delusions.",0,0.5207767808656010,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,TRUE,0.020776780865601100
8580219,Effect of state of alertness on the heart rate response to ocular compression in human infants.,"Because the state of alertness exerts a profound influence on autonomic cardiac control, we hypothesized, that the heart rate response to a vagal stimulus, i.e., ocular compression, may differ during different states of alertness. We studied 8 healthy infants with a postconceptional age of 35-41 weeks (mean +/- SD 37.9 +/- 2.1 weeks). They underwent a standardized ocular compression test during polygraphically controlled wakefulness, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM (NREM) sleep. The R-R intervals were measured (1) during the 60 s preceding the ocular compression test, to determine the mean control R-R interval, and (2) during compression. Percent R-R interval was defined as the longest R-R interval in milliseconds during the test divided by the mean control R-R interval and multiplied by 100. The longest R-R interval during the test was significantly greater in REM sleep than in wakefulness (p < 0.05) and in NREM sleep (p < 0.01):939 +/- 360, 623 +/- 355, and 538 +/- 60 ms, respectively. The percent R-R interval was significantly greater in REM sleep than in NREM sleep (p < 0.01):236 +/- 91 and 129 +/- 16, respectively. The time from the longest R-R interval to return to mean control R-R interval, i.e., vagal escape, was significantly shorter in REM sleep than in NREM sleep and in wakefulness (p < 0.01): 843 +/- 168, 2,131 +/- 712, and 2,078 +/- 913 ms, respectively. This study indicates that the state of alertness should be defined when performing tests on autonomic reflexes in infants.",0,0.5063103960335730,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,TRUE,0.006310396033572750

9305415,Alertness and memory after sleep deprivation and diazepam intake.,"Benzodiazepines (BZDs) give rise to memory impairments. It has been questioned whether or not these impairments are related to the drug's sedative, alertness-reducing effects. Therefore, in this study, alertness was reduced in healthy subjects both pharmacologically (15 mg diazepam) and non-pharmacologically (24-h sleep deprivation, SD) in order to assess whether these manipulations both gave rise to memory impairments. Twelve subjects were tested using a repeated measures cross-over design. Drug administration was placebo-controlled and double-blind. A subjective alertness reduction was established after diazepam intake and even more after SD. Additionally, performance-disruptive effects were found on psychomotor tasks after both SD and liazepam intake. However, only diazepam, and not SD, impaired delayed recall of a word list and recall of paired associates. Thus a reduction in alertness, i.e. sedation, cannot fully account for BZD-induced memory impairments.",0,0.504838471975485,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,TRUE,0.004838471975485040
