# Data Dictionary: `seed_model_audit.csv`

This file is used to **audit** the baseline classifier’s performance on a labeled subset of PubMed records.  
Each row corresponds to a single article (identified by PMID) with:

- human-assigned label(s),
- model predictions and probabilities, and
- a set of indicator features based on key terms or names associated with consciousness research.

**General notes:**

- All `mentions_...` columns are binary features (0/1) derived by simple string matching over the title and abstract.
- `label`, `model_prob`, `pred`, `mismatch`, and `abs_margin` together support model auditing and error analysis (e.g., examining high-confidence errors vs. low-confidence decisions).
- `pmid` links this audit file back to the main feature table `pubmed_consciousness.csv`.
