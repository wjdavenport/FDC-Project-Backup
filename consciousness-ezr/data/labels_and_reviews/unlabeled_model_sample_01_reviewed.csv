1319639,"[Diagnosis, clinical course and prognosis of parenchymatous- ventricular hemorrhages].","As many as 61 patients with hemorrhagic brain stroke and blood penetration in the ventricular system were subjected to a clinical analysis. Based on the data available, attempts were made to predict an outcome of brain stroke. The authors describe the results of studying different aspects of the diagnostic algorithm of parenchymatous ventricular hemorrhages. In accordance with the clinical and computer-aided tomography data, consciousness disturbances, occlusion hydrocephalus, secondary stem syndrome as well as the localization, volume of hematomas and the degree of the blood filling of the ventricular system may serve as diagnostic predictors of brain hemorrhages. The authors' observations correspond with the conclusions made by foreign scientists that ventricular hemorrhages are not always fatal. Parenchymatous ventricular hemorrhages are likely to eventuate in a favourable outcome owing to the drug treatment.",0.519447950346519,1,0.019447950346519000,0
23634339,Ethical Dilemma and Management of Infertility in HIV Seropositive Discordant Couples: A Case Study in Nigeria.,"The traditional African society places an invaluable premium on procreation and, in some communities, a woman's place in her matrimony is only confirmed on positive reproductive outcome. Infertility is rife in Nigeria, and HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infection is a global pandemic, which has led to a drop in life expectancy across the world. In Nigeria, a number of cultural norms relating to gender roles and power dynamics constitute a serious barrier to issues of sexuality and infertility. Couples are concerned about their infertility diagnostic test being disclosed to each other, especially before marriage. This concern is understandable, especially in an environment that lacks the modern concepts and attitude toward sexual matters. This is complicated by the advent of HIV/AIDS infection and the societal mind-set that look at seropostive individuals as transgressors. At present, sexual and reproductive health rights are currently not in place because ethical issues are not given prominence by many physicians in Nigeria. A case of an infertile and seropostive discordant couple, which raised a lot of medical and ethical concerns, is presented here to awaken the consciousness of Nigerian physicians and stimulate discussions on the ethical matters such as this in clinical practice.",0.46948392225118300,0,0.030516077748816900,0
37030995,Vasovagal syncope: An overview of pathophysiological mechanisms.,"Syncope is a short-term transient loss of consciousness, characterized by rapid onset and complete spontaneous recovery. According to the 2018 European Society of Cardiology guidelines, three different types of syncope have been identified. However, all forms of syncope share a common final pathophysiological event, global cerebral hypoperfusion, which results from the inability of the circulatory system to maintain blood pressure at the level required to efficiently supply blood to the brain. The vasovagal syncope (VVS) is the most common form of syncope. Although, VVS is generally harmless, its frequent occurrence can negatively affect quality of life and increase the risk of adverse events. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying VVS remain obscure. The multifaceted nature of VVS presents a veritable challenge to understanding this condition and developing preventative strategies. Thus, the aim of this review was to discuss the factors contributing to the pathogenesis of VVS and provide guidance for future research.",0.26435408997110200,0,0.23564591002889800,0

This non concordance appear as lesser if it is be considered not only the sleeping waves but also all the electrical signs of the vigil state: non-existent, fluctuating, limited in topography, behind the stimulation, incomplete or emphasized. In this view we study some pathological states: narcotic and alcoholic addictions, confusion and pre-senile illness. Sometimes it is the abnormal sleep (coma or amazement) which alter the vigil state: absent, decreased, etc. Sometimes the vigilance is ""numbed"", the behaviour and the recording are those of lethargy. Sometimes also, the drowsiness has insomnia characteristics, associating a deep sleep loss, a reactivity to stimulations at once emphasized and undiscriminated, and ""strangeness"" insurmontable for the consciousness (perplexity, delusions, nightmare and level anomalies).",0.041701400432590600,0,0.4582985995674090,0
8818094,[Tizanidine for preanesthetic medication].,"The effect of tizanidine given as a premedication on perioperative hemodynamics (mean blood pressure, heart rate), sedation, hypnosis and midazolam requirements for induction were assessed in 68 patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia. Patients were assigned to three groups. Group 1 was premedicated 90 min prior to induction with tizanidine 4 mg po (n = 28); group 2 was premedicated with tizanidine 2 mg po (n = 12); group 3 received no premedication (n = 28). In group 1, increase of mean blood pressure on anesthesia induction was attenuated significantly and sedative and hypnotic effects were stronger significantly compared with other groups. We also found that the amounts of midazolam necessary for loss of consciousness were significantly less in patients who had received tizanidine 4 mg. In conclusion, tizanidine is a useful drug as preanesthetic medication for general anesthesia.",0.05411269799241340,0,0.4458873020075870,0
23509248,Cortical response tracking the conscious experience of threshold duration visual stimuli indicates visual perception is all or none.,"At perceptual threshold, some stimuli are available for conscious access whereas others are not. Such threshold inputs are useful tools for investigating the events that separate conscious awareness from unconscious stimulus processing. Here, viewing unmasked, threshold-duration images was combined with recording magnetoencephalography to quantify differences among perceptual states, ranging from no awareness to ambiguity to robust perception. A four-choice scale was used to assess awareness: ""didn't see"" (no awareness), ""couldn't identify"" (awareness without identification), ""unsure"" (awareness with low certainty identification), and ""sure"" (awareness with high certainty identification). Stimulus-evoked neuromagnetic signals were grouped according to behavioral response choices. Three main cortical responses were elicited. The earliest response, peaking at approximately 100 ms after stimulus presentation, showed no significant correlation with stimulus perception. A late response ( approximately 290 ms) showed moderate correlation with stimulus awareness but could not adequately differentiate conscious access from its absence. By contrast, an intermediate response peaking at approximately 240 ms was observed only for trials in which stimuli were consciously detected. That this signal was similar for all conditions in which awareness was reported is consistent with the hypothesis that conscious visual access is relatively sharply demarcated.",0.7323236786952010,1,0.23232367869520100,1
40291566,Concurrent Thyroid Storm From Postpartum Thyroiditis and Lymphocytic Hypophysitis: A Rare Case.,"Postpartum autoimmune thyroiditis (PAT) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (LH) are rare autoimmune conditions occurring during or after pregnancy. We present a case of a 35-year-old woman who developed thyroid storm because of PAT followed by LH, resulting in panhypopituitarism. Initial presentation included hemodynamic instability, altered consciousness, and hyperthyroid symptoms. She was treated for thyroid storm and subsequently developed hypernatremia, suggestive of diabetes insipidus. MRI revealed features consistent with LH. This case highlights the complex interplay between immune dysregulation and pregnancy-related hormonal changes, leading to concurrent autoimmune thyroiditis and hypophysitis. Prompt recognition and multidisciplinary management involving endocrinology, obstetrics, and critical care are essential for optimizing outcomes in such cases. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and refine management strategies for these rare but potentially serious endocrine complications in the postpartum period.",0.3709662835363240,0,0.12903371646367600,0

39396678,Aesthetic chills modulate reward learning in anhedonic depression.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the potential of experiencing aesthetic chills to enhance reward learning in individuals with elevated depressive symptoms, specifically anhedonia, by investigating the effect of chills on participants' ability to modulate behavior as a function of rewards. METHODS: A total of 103 participants with elevated depressive symptoms took part in the experiment. Among them, 59 participants had depressive symptoms (BDI >/= 20), with 26 classified as ""High Anhedonic"" (HA) and 33 as ""Low Anhedonic"" (LA). Additionally, 39 participants without elevated depressive symptoms (BDI < 20 and SHAPs <32) were included as the control group. We utilized ChillsDB, an open-source database of validated audiovisual stimuli known to elicit chills in the US population. RESULTS: Anhedonic participants who experienced chills demonstrated a significant increase in response bias (p = .004) towards rewards compared to those who did not experience chills. Highlighting specificity, no significant difference in reward bias was observed among LA participants. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the experience of chills has the potential to impact reward learning in anhedonic individuals, aligning with the known neurobiology of this phenomenon. These results highlight the potential of aesthetic chills as a novel approach to elicit and enhance positive affect in depressed populations.",0.16749026818538900,0,0.33250973181461100,0
9777039,Bromocriptine-induced tachycardia in conscious rats: blunted response following isoproterenol pretreatment for 5 days.,"Previous studies have shown that tachycardia induced by intravenous injection of bromocriptine, which persisted after adrenalectomy, was mediated by central dopamine D2 receptor stimulation. Such stimulation could activate central sympathetic outflow to the heart. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether pretreatment with isoproterenol, known to induce cardiac beta-adrenoceptor desensitization, could reduce bromocriptine-induced tachycardia. A 5 day pretreatment with isoproterenol (5 mg/kg/day) induced a 21% increase in the ratio of ventricular dry weight to body weight, compared with saline-pretreated rats. In isolated perfused heart preparations from isoproterenol-pretreated rats, the isoproterenol-induced increase in left ventricular systolic pressure and heart rate was significantly reduced, compared with saline-pretreated rats (the isoproterenol concentration producing 50% of the maximal positive inotropic and chronotropic responses was increased approximately 5- and 4-fold, respectively). In conscious control rats, intravenous injection of bromocriptine (50, 150 and 250 micrograms/kg) decreased mean aortic pressure and increased heart rate in a dose-related manner. Pretreatment with isoproterenol for 5 days reduced bromocriptine-induced tachycardia without affecting hypotension. Cardiac autonomic tone remained of the same order of magnitude irrespective of whether the animal was pretreated with isoproterenol. These results indicate that isoproterenol pretreatment reduces bromocriptine-induced tachycardia mainly through desensitization of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors rather than via an impairment of autonomic regulation of the heart. This supports the hypothesis that bromocriptine-induced activation of central dopamine D2 receptors increases heart rate via activation of central sympathetic outflow to the heart.",0.06994943378387720,0,0.4300505662161230,0
33893655,Neural correlates of nonjudgmental perception induced through meditation.,"Ambiguous sensory stimuli provide insight into the dynamics of the human mind. When viewing substantially different images in the two eyes (i.e., binocular rivalry (BR)), perception spontaneously fluctuates between the two images along with patch-like mixtures of the two, with limited ability to control such fluctuations. Previous studies have shown that long-term meditation training can enable a more stable perception by reducing such fluctuations. Using electroencephalography, we investigated the neural bases of perceptual stabilization in long-term meditators (LTMs) and age-matched meditation-naive control participants. We measured BR alternations before and after participants practiced meditation. We expected that perceptual stabilization through meditation could occur via one of two neurocognitive mechanisms: (1) a more engaged/effortful attention reflected by increased long-range phase synchronization between early visual sensory and higher-level brain regions, or (2) a disengaged/nonevaluative form of attention reflected by decreased phase synchronization. We found that compared with control participants, LTMs were in a significantly longer mixed perceptual state following concentrative meditation practice. The increase in mixed percepts across individuals was strongly correlated with reduced parietal-occipital gamma-band (30-50 Hz) phase synchrony. These findings suggest that concentrative meditation enables a nonevaluative perceptual stance supported by reduced communication between hierarchical visual brain regions.",0.412183268506324,0,0.08781673149367600,0
33044234,MRI in disorders of consciousness.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the study of brain-injured patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC), structural and functional MRI seek to provide insights into the neural correlates of consciousness, identify neurophysiologic signatures of covert consciousness, and identify biomarkers for recovery of consciousness. RECENT FINDINGS: Cortical volume, white matter volume and integrity, and structural connectivity across many grey and white matter regions have been shown to vary with level of awareness in brain-injured patients. Resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) within and between canonical cortical networks also correlates with DoC patients' level of awareness. Stimulus-based and motor-imagery fMRI paradigms have identified some behaviorally unresponsive DoC patients with cortical processing and activation patterns that mirror healthy controls. Emerging techniques like dynamic rs-FC have begun to identify temporal trends in brain-wide connectivity that may represent novel neural correlates of consciousness. SUMMARY: Structural and functional MRI will continue to advance our understanding of brain regions supporting human consciousness. Measures of regional and global white matter integrity and rs-FC in particular networks have shown significant improvement over clinical features in identifying acute and chronic DoC patients likely to recover awareness. As they are refined, functional MRI paradigms may additionally provide opportunities for interacting with behaviorally unresponsive patients.",0.7975541721563630,1,0.29755417215636300,1

30213588,Prehospital clinical presentation in patients with acute coronary syndrome complicated by cardiogenic shock: A single center study.,"BACKGROUND: The development of cardiogenic shock remains the most important factor affecting the prognosis of patients with acute coronary syndrome. Despite significant advances in treatment, achieved in the last two decades, the mortality rate is still very high. The development of knowledge about the pathophysiology of cardiogenic shock, necessitates a thorough and comprehensive assessment of its progress at all stages of medical care. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the prehospital clinical presentation in patients with acute coronary syndrome complicated by cardiogenic shock. METHODS: The population of our study consisted of 40 patients with acute coronary syndrome complicated by cardiogenic shock who were transported to the Intensive Cardiac Therapy Clinic by ambulances directly from place of the event in order to implement primary coronary intervention. The control group was selected among age, gender and infarct location-matched patients with acute coronary syndrome uncomplicated by shock. The clinical presentation in investigated patients was assessed on the basis of the data contained in the medical records of Emergency Medical Services teams. RESULTS: In univariate logistic regression analysis eight prehospital clinical symptoms proved to be statistically significant predictors of the development of cardiogenic shock: fainting and/or impaired consciousness, pale skin, cold skin, clammy skin, dyspnea, pulmonary congestion, peripheral cyanosis and hyperglycemia >11,1 mmol/l. In the multivariate model significant predictors of cardiogenic shock development were: pale skin and hyperglycemia >11.1 mmol/l. A risk prediction model was constructed. It proved to differentiate patients from study and control group highly significantly (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute coronary syndrome who develop cardiogenic shock, present a different clinical symptoms at the moment of the first medical contact. The proposed 4S Scale can be used for quick assessment of risk in patients with acute coronary syndrome before the development of a fully-blown cardiogenic shock with severe, long-lasting hypotonia.",0.07591823288831860,0,0.4240817671116810,0
33746825,The Bibliometric Analysis of the Sustainable Influence of Physical Education for University Students.,"With the awakening of people's health consciousness, the concept and practice of health promotion has become the main target of health policies throughout the world. In this study, the relationship between physical education and health promotion was examined. Art students from a university in Taoyuan were selected for research, and a total of 320 questionnaires were issued. Invalid and incomplete questionnaires were eliminated, with a total of 227 valid questionnaires. Finally, the LISREL (Linear Structural Relations) model was used to analyze the correlation between various factors and health promotion. The results of the model analysis show that in terms of basic fit, the three factors of physical education (course design, teaching content, and activity design) have a high correlation with the influence of physical education, reaching a significant level (t > 1.96, p < 0.05). In terms of influence on sports participation, the three factors (physiological factors, psychological factors, social factors) of sports participation reached a significant level (t > 1.96, p < 0.05). The two factors of health promotion (physiological health, and mental health and practical ideas) have a high correlation with the influence of health promotion, reaching a significant level (t > 1.96, p < 0.05). In terms of overall mode fit, the overall mode fit standard chi(2)/Df was 1.344, less than the standard value of 3 or less, and the RMR value was 0.007, indicating that the chi(2)/DF and RMR result standards were appropriate, and the chi-square value was very sensitive to the sample size. Therefore, there was a positive correlation among physical education, sports participation, and health promotion. In conclusion, physical activities can improve the human body's immune function, reduce the symptoms of chronic diseases, and positively promote health. The research result is important for emphasizing the benefit of sports to art students, and provides reference for improving the quality of school physical education, and the physical and mental health level of people in Taiwan.",0.45986720112578500,0,0.04013279887421510,0
23210468,Practicing Reiki does not appear to routinely produce high-intensity electromagnetic fields from the heart or hands of Reiki practitioners.,"OBJECTIVES: The study objective was to determine whether Reiki practice increases the electromagnetic field strength from the heart and hands of Reiki practitioners. RATIONALE: This study repeated experiments performed 20 years ago that detected exceptionally high-strength electromagnetic fields (100 nT) from the hands of several energy healers. The equipment used was far more sensitive than in the original studies. DESIGN: Using a Magnes 2500 WH SQUID, the electromagnetic field from the hands and heart of each of 3 Reiki masters was measured when they were (1) not practicing Reiki, (2) sending Reiki to a distant person, and (3) sending Reiki to a person in the room. Similar measurements were made on 4 Reiki-naive volunteers before and after they received a Reiki training/attunement enabling them to self-administer Reiki. SETTING/LOCATION: The study setting was the Scripps Institute, San Diego, CA. OUTCOME MEASURES: Magnetic field intensity of hands and heart recorded over 5-minute sessions with corresponding frequency spectra. RESULTS: For all subjects, under all conditions, sensors closest to the heart and the hands produced spikes of 2 pT corresponding to the heartbeat. Recordings from 2 Masters and 1 volunteer showed a low-intensity sine wave oscillation of 0.25-0.3 Hz (intensity 0.1-0.5 pT) whether or not they were practicing Reiki. This oscillation probably reflected respiratory sinus arrhythmia, judged by comparison with recent previous studies. These signals were not detected in the original studies. In the current study, no electromagnetic field intensities greater than 3 pT were observed in any of the recordings. CONCLUSIONS: Practicing Reiki does not appear to routinely produce high-intensity electromagnetic fields from the heart or hands. Alternatively, it is possible that energy healing is stimulated by tuning into an external environmental radiation, such as the Schumann resonance, which was blocked in the present study by the strong magnetic shielding surrounding the SQUID.",0.30634640154837800,0,0.19365359845162200,0

It seems that the published critique of Gustavo Caetano-Anolles (GCA)(2) to Shanta's paper is purely emotional and does not have any valid scientific or philosophical justification. In his rebuttal to Caetano-Anolles's critique, Shanta(3) highlighted how the concept of 'Organic Whole' in Vedanta is completely different than that of Creationist Movement and Intelligent Design. Thus Caetano-Anolle's attempt to equate Vedanta with Creationist Movement and Intelligent Design is merely superfluous. This article highlights the validity of the argument made by Bhakti Niskama Shanta(1) and thus also intends to clarify why the Caetano-Anolles critique is groundless.",0.5681452962097830,1,0.06814529620978270,1
34802696,Lateralisation of subcortical functional connectivity during and after general anaesthesia.,"BACKGROUND: Arousal and awareness are two important components of consciousness states. Functional neuroimaging has furthered our understanding of cortical and thalamocortical mechanisms of awareness. Investigating the relationship between subcortical functional connectivity and arousal has been challenging owing to the relatively small size of brainstem structures and thalamic nuclei, and their depth in the brain. METHODS: Resting state functional MRI scans of 72 healthy volunteers were acquired before, during, 1 h after, and 1 day after sevoflurane general anaesthesia. Functional connectivity of subcortical regions of interest vs whole brain and homotopic functional connectivity for assessment of left-right symmetry analyses of both cortical and subcortical regions of interest were performed. Both analyses used high resolution atlases generated from deep brain stimulation applications. RESULTS: Functional connectivity in subcortical loci within the thalamus and of the ascending reticular activating system was sharply restricted under anaesthesia, featuring a general lateralisation of connectivity. Similarly, left-right homology was sharply reduced under anaesthesia. Subcortical bilateral functional connectivity was not fully restored after emergence from anaesthesia, although greater restoration was seen between ascending reticular activating system loci and specific thalamic nuclei thought to be involved in promoting and maintaining arousal. Functional connectivity was fully restored to baseline by the following day. CONCLUSIONS: Functional connectivity in the subcortex is sharply restricted and lateralised under general anaesthesia. This restriction may play a part in loss and return of consciousness. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02275026.",0.16926715828918500,0,0.33073284171081500,0

23093913,Strategies to fight stigma toward people with mental disorders: perspectives from different stakeholders.,"This study aims to provide a more complete and exhaustive perspective on the whole range of potential strategies to fight stigma by considering the perspectives of different stakeholders. Delegates to a Canadian conference were invited to participate in a survey that focused on stigma, from which the responses to the following question were analyzed: tell us briefly what you do to reduce prejudice and stigma toward people with a diagnosis of mental disorder? From 253 participants, 15 categories of strategies to fight stigma were identified from the verbatim (e.g., sharing/encouraging disclosure). These categories fell under six main themes: education, contact, protestation, person centered, working on recovery and social inclusion, and reflexive consciousness. The occurrence of these themes was different among stakeholders (clinical, organizational, and experiential knowledge). For example, people with mental disorders (experiential knowledge) often mentioned contact and person centered strategies, while mental health professionals (clinical knowledge) preferred education and working on recovery and social inclusion strategies. The results from this study highlight the need to pay more attention to the concept of disclosure of mental disorders in the process for de-stigmatization. Future studies are needed to assess the impact of the emerging strategies to fight stigma in the community.",0.3063467292220390,0,0.1936532707779610,0
28152662,Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome as a complication of Henoch-Schonlein purpura in a seven-year-old girl.,"Introduction Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a multisystem small vessel vasculitis. Neurologic manifestations are uncommon. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a rare complication of Henoch-Schonlein purpura with typical clinical and neuroimaging findings that occurs most commonly in the setting of severe hypertension and renal injury. Case presentation A seven-year-old girl was admitted to our institution presenting with clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Glucocorticoid therapy was initiated, but five days following her admission, she developed altered consciousness, seizures, arterial hypertension, and cortical blindness. Brain MRI scan revealed areas of vasogenic oedema in parieto-occipital lobes, consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. She was immediately initiated on antihypertensives and antiepileptics, which successfully improved her neurologic symptoms. Further laboratory work-up disclosed a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis secondary to Henoch-Schonlein purpura that was the likely cause of her sudden blood pressure elevation. Immunosuppressive therapy was undertaken, and at one-year follow-up, the patient exhibited complete renal and neurologic recovery. Conclusion Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a severe complication of Henoch-Schonlein purpura. If promptly diagnosed and treated, children with Henoch-Schonlein purpura presenting with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome usually have a good prognosis. Clinicians should be familiar with the characteristic presentation of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and be aware that hypertension and renal injury may predispose Henoch-Schonlein purpura patients to developing this complication.",0.0708725056939817,0,0.4291274943060180,0

While vitally important vessels in this region show a high degree of variability, some anatomical variants might be involved in characteristic complications. OBSERVATIONS: We present the case of a 40-year-old female patient with acromegaly due to a pituitary adenoma that was transsphenoidally operated. Postoperatively, the patient presented with bilateral unresponsive mydriasis, loss of consciousness and tetraparesis.

31884753,[The specificity of moral aspects of activity of medical workers in Health Care of Russia].,"The transformation of values and dissemination of consumerism ideology, associated with active implementation of market mechanisms of functioning in the Russian health care system, significantly affected processes of implementing moral aspects of activities of medical workers. The transition of physician and patient to buying and selling relationships initiated the situation when the life and health maintenance is considered not as an ultimate purpose of medical profession, but as a service supplied for particular fee. Moreover, quality of medical care supplied is considered as directly proportional to its cost. This fact results, from one hand, in corruption in health care system initiated by patients themselves because unofficial fee is significantly lower than the established one. From the other hand, it results in the fact that service supplied to patient for free in state polyclinics is provided untimely and not always is has needed quality due to lacking of necessary resources. As a result, the moral purpose of medical profession becomes minor, yielding to commercial relationships. However, these occurrences do not disprove the fact that the patient, in case of visiting physician, remains completely dependent on one's professionalism and responsibility, despite the abundance of private medical institutions and the formal freedom of choosing type of medical service and medical specialist providing it. The high moral culture was and continue to be an obligatory characteristic of successfulness and professionalism of physician. In the new economic conditions, it can become a competitive advantage, since every patient wishes to see in physician not only competent specialist, but also a person capable to empathize and responsibly treat with responsibility another life that was trusted to him.",0.2167348114770930,0,0.28326518852290700,0
31535889,Evaluative conditioning of pattern-masked nonwords requires perceptual awareness.,"The evaluative conditioning (EC) phenomenon is central to the study of preference acquisition and attitude formation. Early studies have reported EC in the absence of awareness, but more recent work has questioned this conclusion. In previous work, using briefly presented and pattern-masked conditioned stimuli (CSs), we found that above-chance forced-choice identification of CSs is necessary for EC. Here we extend this work by addressing more directly the inherently subjective issue of consciousness. In 2 studies, we assessed whether above-threshold perceptual awareness of CSs is necessary for EC. Contrasting unconscious learning claims, EC was absent under low and intermediate levels of perceptual awareness. Additional findings suggest that the perceptual awareness task does not interfere with EC, and that it is more sensitive than memory-based awareness proxies. We also found that a confounded variant of the forced-choice identification task can artifactually induce EC; and that an unconfounded version of the task does not induce nor interfere with EC. We discuss limitations of the present studies as well as their relevance for the debate about the automaticity of evaluative learning.

METHODS: High-density 64-electrode electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during 50 seizures acquired from 11 patients undergoing right unilateral ECT allowed for evaluation of spatiotemporal characteristics of CPCs via source localization and spectral analysis. RESULTS: Peak-amplitude CPC scalp topology was consistent across seizures, showing maximal positive polarity over the midline fronto-central region and maximal negative polarity over the suborbital regions. The sources of these peak potentials were localized to the bilateral medial thalamus and cingulate cortical regions. Delta, beta, and gamma oscillations were correlated with the peak amplitude of CPCs during seizures induced during ketamine, whereas delta and gamma oscillations were associated with CPC peaks during etomidate anesthesia (excluding the dose-charge titration). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the consistency of CPC presence across participant, stimulus charge, time, and anesthetic agent, with peaks localized to bilateral medial thalamus and cingulate cortical regions and associated with delta, beta, and gamma band oscillations (depending on the anesthetic condition). SIGNIFICANCE: The consistency and reproducibility of CPCs offers ECT as a new avenue for studying the dynamics of generalized seizure activity and thalamocortical networks.",0.26736142764767200,0,0.23263857235232800,0
35959074,Between Fact and Fabrication: How Visual Art Might Nurture Environmental Consciousness.,"Previous studies have highlighted the communicative limitations of artistic visualizations, which are often too conceptual or interpretive to enhance public understanding of (and volition to act upon) scientific climate information. This seems to suggest a need for greater factuality/concreteness in artistic visualization projects, which may indeed be the case. However, in this paper, we synthesize insights from environmental psychology, the psychology of art, and intermediate disciplines like eco-aesthetics, to argue that artworks-defined by their counterfactual qualities-can be effective for stimulating elements of environmental consciousness. We also argue that different artworks may yield different effects depending on how they combine counter/factual strategies. In so doing, we assert that effective artistic perceptualization-here expressed as affectivization-exceeds the faithful translation of facts from one mode to another, and cannot be encapsulated in a single example of un/successful art.",0.5860425030828950,1,0.08604250308289510,0
32593772,Patterns of neural activity in the mouse brain: Wakefulness vs. General anesthesia.,"In light of the general shift from rats to mice as the leading rodent model in neuroscience research we used c-Fos expression as a tool to survey brain regions in the mouse in which neural activity differs between the states of wakefulness and pentobarbital-induced general anesthesia. The aim was to complement prior surveys carried out in rats. In addition to a broad qualitative review, 28 specific regions of interest (ROIs) were evaluated quantitatively. Nearly all ROIs in the cerebral cortex showed suppressed activity during anesthesia. Subcortically, however, some ROIs showed suppression, some showed little change, and some showed increased activity. The overall picture was similar to the rat. Special attention was devoted to ROIs significantly activated during anesthesia, as such loci might actively drive the transition to anesthetic unconsciousness rather than responding passively to inhbitory agents distributed globally (the ""wet blanket"" hypothesis). Twelve such ""anesthesia-on"" ROIs were identified: the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, tuberomamillary nucleus, lateral habenular nucleus, dentate gyrus, nucleus raphe pallidus, central amygdaloid nucleus, perifornical lateral hypothalamus, ventro-lateral preoptic area, lateral septum, paraventricular thalamic nucleus and zona incerta. The same primary anti-FOS antibody was used in all mice, but two alternative reporter systems were employed: ABC-diaminobenzidine and the currently more popular AlexaFluor488. Fluorescence tagging revealed far fewer FOS-immunoreactive neurons, sounding an alert that the reporter system chosen can have major effects on results obtained.",0.1907853302232390,0,0.30921466977676100,0
12492612,Phenytoin pharmacokinetics and clinical effects in African children following fosphenytoin and chloramphenicol coadministration.,"AIMS: Some children with malaria and convulsions also have concurrent bacterial meningitis. Chloramphenicol is used to treat the latter whereas phenytoin is used for convulsions. Since chloramphenicol inhibits the metabolism of phenytoin in vivo, we studied the effects of chloramphenicol on phenytoin pharmacokinetics in children with malaria. METHODS: Multiple intravenous (i.v.) doses of chloramphenicol succinate (CAP) (25 mg kg-1 6 hourly for 72 h) and a single intramuscular (i.m.) seizure prophylactic dose of fosphenytoin (18 mg kg-1 phenytoin sodium equivalents) were concomitantly administered to 15 African children with malaria. Control children (n = 13) with malaria received a similar dose of fosphenytoin and multiple i.v. doses (25 mg kg-1 8 hourly for 72 h) of cefotaxime (CEF). Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, level of consciousness and convulsion episodes were monitored. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma phenytoin concentrations were determined. RESULTS: The area under the plasma unbound phenytoin concentration-time curve (AUC(0, infinity ); means (CAP, CEF): 58.5, 47.6 micro g ml-1 h; 95% CI for difference between means: -35.0, 11.4), the peak unbound phenytoin concentrations (Cmax; medians: 1.12, 1.29 micro g ml-1; 95% CI: -0.5, 0.04), the times to Cmax (tmax; medians: 4.0, 4.0 h; 95% CI: -2.0, 3.7), the CSF:plasma phenytoin ratios (means: 0.21, 0.22; 95% CI: -0.8, 0.10), the fraction of phenytoin unbound (means: 0.06, 0.09; 95% CI: -0.01, 0.07) and the cardiovascular parameters were not significantly different between CAP and CEF groups. However, mean terminal elimination half-life (t1/2,z) was significantly longer (23.7, 15.5 h; 95% CI: 1.71, 14.98) in the CAP group compared with the CEF group. Seventy per cent of the children had no convulsions during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant administration of chloramphenicol and a single i.m. dose of fosphenytoin alters the t1/2,z but not the other pharmacokinetic parameters or clinical effects of phenytoin in African children with severe malaria. Moreover, a single i.m. dose of fosphenytoin provides anticonvulsant prophylaxis in the majority of the children over 72 h. However, a larger study would be needed to investigate the effect of concomitant administration of multiple doses of the two drugs in this population of patients.",0.038588622792591400,0,0.46141137720740900,0
16774619,Valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy.,"Valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy (VHE) is an unusual complication characterized by a decreasing level of consciousness, focal neurological deficits, cognitive slowing, vomiting, drowsiness, and lethargy. We have thoroughly reviewed the predisposing factors and their screening, the biochemical and physiopathological mechanisms involved, the different treatments described, and those that are being investigated. Etiopathogenesis is not completely understood, although hyperammonemia has been postulated as the main cause of the clinical syndrome. The increase in serum ammonium level is due to several mechanisms, the most important one appearing to be the inhibition of carbamoylphosphate synthetase-I, the enzyme that begins the urea cycle. Polytherapy with several drugs, such as phenobarbital and topiramate, seems to contribute to hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia leads to an increase in the glutamine level in the brain, which produces astrocyte swelling and cerebral edema. There are several studies that suggest that treatment with supplements of carnitine can lead to an early favorable clinical response due to the probable carnitine deficiency induced by a valproate (VPA) treatment. Development of the progressive confusional syndrome, associated with an increase in seizure frequency after VPA treatment onset, obliges us to rule out VHE by screening for blood ammonium levels and the existence of urea cycle enzyme deficiency, such as ornithine carbamoyltransferase deficiency. Electroencephalography (EEG) is characterized by signs of severe encephalopathy with continuous generalized slowing, a predominance of theta and delta activity, occasional bursts of frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity, and triphasic waves. These EEG findings, as well as clinical manifestations and hyperammonemia, tend to normalize after VPA withdrawal.",0.12844885840873900,0,0.371551141591261,0
25485789,A survey of patient motion in disorders of consciousness and optimization of its retrospective correction.,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be seriously impaired by patient motion. The purpose of this study was to characterize the typical motion in a clinical population of patients in disorders of consciousness and compare the performance of retrospective correction with rigid-body realignment as implemented in widely used software packages. 63 subjects were scanned with an fMRI visual checkerboard paradigm using a 3T scanner. Time series were corrected for motion, and the resulting transformations were used to calculate a motion score. SPM, FSL, AFNI and AIR were evaluated by comparing the motion obtained by re-running the tool on the corrected data. A publicly available sample fMRI dataset was modified with the motion detected in each patient with each tool. The performance of each tool was measured by comparing the number of supra-threshold voxels after standard fMRI analysis, both in the sample dataset and in simulated fMRI data. We assessed the effect of user-changeable parameters on motion correction in SPM. We found the equivalent motion in the patient population to be 1.4mm on average. There was no significant difference in performance between SPM, FSL and AFNI. AIR was considerably worse, and took more time to run. We found that in SPM the quality factor and interpolation method have no effect on the cluster size, while higher separation and smoothing reduce it. We showed that the main packages SPM, FSL and AFNI are equally suitable for retrospective motion correction of fMRI time series. We show that typically only 80% of activated voxels are recovered by retrospective motion correction.",0.5525026915729890,1,0.052502691572988900,0
35817130,Anesthetic loss of consciousness induced by chemogenetic excitation of mesopontine effector neurons.,"Although general anesthesia is normally induced by systemic dosing, an anesthetic state can be induced in rodents by microinjecting minute quantities of GABAergic agents into the brainstem mesopontine tegmental anesthesia area (MPTA). Correspondingly, lesions to the MPTA render rats relatively insensitive to standard anesthetic doses delivered systemically. Using a chemogenetic approach we have identified and characterized a small subpopulation of neurons restricted to the MPTA which, when excited, render the animal anesthetic by sensorimotor (immobility) and electroencephalographic (EEG) criteria. These ""effector-neurons"" do not express GABA(A)delta-Rs, the likely target of GABAergic anesthetics. Rather, we report a distinct sub-population of nearby MPTA neurons which do. During anesthetic induction these likely excite the effector-neurons by disinhibition. Within the effector population ~ 70% appear to be glutamatergic, ~30% GABAergic and ~ 40% glycinergic. Most are projection neurons that send ascending or descending axons to distant targets associated with the individual functional components of general anesthesia: atonia, analgesia, amnesia, and loss-of-consciousness.",0.22329827150945800,0,0.27670172849054200,0

The results of therapy were evaluated statistically according to a number of clinical scales and neurophysiologic indices (EEG and evoked potentials with mapping of bioelectric activity). The results were compared with the data about 56 patients of the control group which were treated by traditional method without application of notropil. Notropil was applied by two ways: small doses (4-12 g daily) during 5 days or high doses (10-12 g daily) during 30 days from the moment when the patient admitted to the hospital. Intravenous injections of the drug were used in all cases as well as its internal administration. It was showed either efficiency of the drug, especially in high doses, in early beginning of the treatment and its duration for at least 30 days or good tolerance of the drug. Authors supposed that application of pyracetam is not adequate in strokes with severe disorders of consciousness and cerebral edema.",0.07959848503495400,0,0.42040151496504600,0
18196445,"Theanine, gamma-glutamylethylamide, a unique amino acid in tea leaves, modulates neurotransmitter concentrations in the brain striatum interstitium in conscious rats.","Theanine (gamma-glutamylethylamide) is one of the major amino acid components in green tea and can pass through the blood-brain barrier. Recent studies suggest that theanine affects the mammalian central nervous system; however, the detailed mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated the effect of theanine on neurotransmission in the brain striatum by in vivo brain microdialysis. Theanine injection into the rat brain striatum did not increase the concentration of excitatory neurotransmitters in the perfusate. On the other hand, theanine injection increased the concentration of glycine in the perfusate. Because it has been reported that theanine promotes dopamine release in the rat striatum, we investigated the glycine and dopamine concentrations in the perfusate. Co-injection of glycine receptor antagonist, strychnine, reduced theanine-induced changes in dopamine. Moreover, AMPA receptor antagonist, which regulates glycine and GABA release from glia cells, inhibited these effects of theanine and this result was in agreement with the known inhibitory effect of theanine at AMPA receptors.",0.1436601968267350,0,0.3563398031732660,0

32271039,Development of youth advocacy and sociopolitical efficacy as dimensions of critical consciousness within gender-sexuality alliances.,"Attention to youth advocacy and sociopolitical efficacy has been evident in developmental research on critical consciousness, yet this literature has given little attention to sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth or issues, or to the interplay between these dimensions of critical consciousness over time. We addressed these limitations within the context of gender-sexuality alliances (GSAs). Among 366 youth members (M(age) = 15.53 years) in 38 GSAs across Massachusetts who completed surveys at the beginning and end of the school year, multilevel models indicated that youth who reported more active engagement in GSAs at the beginning of the school year reported greater advocacy throughout the year and greater sociopolitical efficacy at the year's end (adjusting for baseline advocacy and efficacy). There was a significant indirect association between greater GSA engagement and greater sociopolitical efficacy at the year's end through reported advocacy done over the school year. Furthermore, group-level contextual effects indicated that youth in GSAs with a more youth-led orientation reported doing less advocacy but reported greater sociopolitical efficacy at the year's end than youth in GSAs with less of a youth-led orientation. Finally, advocacy and sociopolitical efficacy were reciprocally associated with one another: Greater initial efficacy was associated with greater advocacy over the school year, and advocacy was associated with greater efficacy at the year's end. These findings extend the critical consciousness literature and carry implications for how GSAs and similar groups could support SGM youth and their allies in resisting oppression.

15029082,[Benzodiazepines and forensic aspects].,"Adverse effects of benzodiazepines are well known since the first one was used in 1958 (chlordiazepoxide). The literature collects study-cases or rarely controlled studies concerning side effects or paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines. They mostly described drowsiness and behavioral disinhibition, including increased well-being feeling but also hostility, rage access with feeling of invulnerability, serious crimes and sometimes homicides. Delusional, manic, confusional or depressive states are also pointed out. Rate for aggressive behaviour is 0.3 to 0.7% but distinction should be done between accidental or ""idiosyncratic"" reaction and voluntary sought disinhibition, clearly more frequent. No benzodiazepine has any specificity for these adverse effects but pharmacology, doses, associated drugs (or alcohol) and psychopathology interact to produce hazardous psychic states. Pharmacology: GABA induces a decrease in serotonin compound and vigilance. Pharmacokinetic: first dose effect or over-dose effect, short half-life, lipophily, affinity, digestive absorption, active metabolites interact. Psychopathology: age, alcohol association, psychological status (high initial level of hostility, impulsivity, frustration, personality disorder and depressive status). External conditions: chronic illness, affective and professional frustrations, physical or psychic exhaustion contribute also. Some benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam, diazepam, clorazepate, triazolam, alprazolam, lorazepam, for example) are more often concerned for pharmacokinetics characteristics but also prescription habits. Forensic aspects should be considered in case of homicide. Especially, reality of benzodiazepines consumption and awareness of the potential paradoxical reaction should be precisely evaluated. Special focus on voluntary induced disinhibition has to be done for forensic considerations. Relationship but also crime facilitations are sometimes consciously sought. Some benzodiazepines have already been identified for this use: flunitrazepam, clorazepate but also triazolam and temazepam in UK, alprazolam in USA. Flunitrazepam is prohibited in USA and considered as narcotics in France. A Swedish study showed that violent acts were more frequent and serious in juvenile offenders taking flunitrazepam/alcohol than other young offenders staying in the same correctional institution. They recommended classification of flunitrazepam as narcotic. A study from Belgium with drug addicts concluded in the same way and asked for an increased information of professionals and a more efficient control of the delivery. Before concluding to idiosyncratic effect, and then possibly to penal irresponsibility, the forensic approach should consider: firstly the reality of the benzodiazepines absorption and implication in committing violence (urine test, chronology, amnesia); secondly, the association of unusual behaviour and converging circumstances (pharmacological, pharmacokinetic, psychopathology, external conditions); thirdly the consumer's knowledge of the disinhibition effect. In our prison practice, we have to be particularly cautious as population frequently associates personality disorder, drug addiction and high level of frustration related to penitential context. Special information should be given to inmates when benzodiazepines are prescribed, but more extensively, a preventive strategy should be adopted in general population.",0.16231528969682700,0,0.337684710303173,0
29601274,REVISITING THE SAFE PLACE:Method and Regulatory Aspects in Psychotherapy when Easing Allostatic Overload in Traumatized Patients.,"Safe-place inductions are considered important altered states of consciousness (ASC) to be (re)installed during trauma-informed psychotherapy. Coregulation aimed at changing implicit relational knowing and increasing integration and coherence through relational work and hypnotic techniques is crucial, as clients' abilities to self-soothe and regulate have become seriously impaired. Thus, resource-oriented metaphors as inner strength imagery is advocated. Also, methods such as creative-arts therapy and neurofeedback will induce ASCs, as most methods used with complex traumatized clients, due to their high hypnotizability. When positive or soothing imagery or relationally held suggestions for changed attentional focus are added to both psychodynamic psychotherapy and CBT, a hetero-hypnosis will be induced-a prerequisite for phase-specific trauma therapy aimed at changing inner schemas and scripts.",0.20813158214119700,0,0.2918684178588030,0
11840575,Honor your father and your mother.,"While on the one hand there is much mutual love and care in the relationship between parents and their offspring, there may, on the other hand, be also much mutual 'sound and fury', which sometimes is far from 'signifying nothing' (William Shakespeare, Macbeth). Indeed, from conception on, individuals are confronted with parent-offspring conflicts of all kinds. Initially these conflicts concern physiological matters (implantation, nutrition, weaning, etc.), but later in life the accent is on psychological ('you must this', 'you must that', 'don't do that' etc.) and social affairs, and phenomena such as child abuse, infanticide and incest may occur. It is, therefore, certainly not self-evident that children honor their parents. To reinforce their position, parents (societies) may appeal to a 'divine' commandment which helps them make their children suppress any tendency to conflict toward them (and hence to their culture), so that children conform to their parents' norms and values. When such psychological and sociological parent-offspring conflicts are not resolved satisfactorily, it can be suggested, children may (consciously or unconsciously) have aggressive feelings toward their parents: Freud's 'Oedipus complex'. This complex, it is argued, can also be seen as a parent-offspring conflict. Given their biological basis, parent-offspring conflicts can hardly be considered as abnormal. Conflicts between adults and their offspring have always existed and will always exist, simply because it is inherent in our genetic make-up: parents and offspring of sexually reproducing species--humans included--are only about 50% genetically related and hence have different interests at all levels of being. Indeed, parent-offspring conflicts are such stuff as we are made on, and our little life is rounded with its consequences (adapted from William Shakespeare, The Tempest).",0.19350176999650400,0,0.3064982300034960,0
33388740,Influenza-Associated Encephalopathy and Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy in Children: A Retrospective Single-Center Study.,"BACKGROUND Although influenza primarily affects the respiratory system, it can cause severe neurological complications, especially in younger children, but knowledge about the early indicators of acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is limited. The main purpose of this article is to summarize the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of neurological complications of influenza in children, and to identify factors associated with ANE. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a retrospective study of children with confirmed influenza with neurological complications treated between 01/2014 and 12/2019 at Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center. A receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was performed to determine the prognostic value of selected variables. RESULTS Sixty-three children with IAE (n=33) and ANE (n=30) were included. Compared with the IAE group, the ANE group showed higher proportions of fever and acute disturbance of consciousness, higher alanine aminotransferase, higher aspartate aminotransferase, higher creatinine kinase, higher procalcitonin, higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein, and lower CSF white blood cells (all P<0.05). The areas under the curve (AUCs) for procalcitonin and CSF proteins, used to differentiate IAE and ANE, were 0.790 and 0.736, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of PCT >4.25 ng/ml to predict ANE were 73.3% and 100.0%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of CSF protein >0.48 g/L to predict ANE were 76.7% and 69.7%, respectively. Thirteen (43.3%) children with ANE and none with IAE died (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS High levels of CSF protein and serum procalcitonin might be used as early indicators for ANE. All children admitted with neurological findings, especially during the influenza season, should be evaluated for influenza-related neurological complications.",0.06514941515427200,0,0.434850584845728,0

Here, we describe the case of a patient who presented a medial left giant lesser sphenoid wing meningioma involving the supraclinoid carotid artery. One week after surgery, she developed vasospasm whose treatment using milrinone achieved excellent results. CASE DESCRIPTION: This is the case of a 23-year-old female with a large meningioma of the middle third of the lesser wing of the left sphenoid. Furthermore, the patient had symptoms of headache, diplopia, and left amaurosis (Video 1). The lesion involved the supraclinoid left carotid artery, causing significant stenosis of the vessel. The patient underwent surgical treatment without complications. One week after the procedure, she evolved with lowered level of consciousness, complete, and proportionate right hemiparesis and right Babinski's sign. Angiographic study demonstrated significant stenosis of the left supraclinoid artery. After endovascular treatment with milrinone, the patient evolved with immediate improvement of signs and symptoms.Video 1:Surgical procedure. Video is accessible from the portal. CONCLUSION: Giant meningiomas with vascular involvement involve a higher risk of postoperative vascular complications. Other studies should be carried out to predict these complications and thus develop preventive measures.",0.3966624312095740,0,0.10333756879042600,0

34383773,Potency of propofol for inducing loss of consciousness in end-stage kidney disease patients.,"It can be difficult for anesthesiologists to determine the optimal dose of propofol for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients due to changes in drug disposition. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potency of propofol for inducing loss of consciousness in ESKD patients. Patients with normal kidney function (Control group, n = 15), those with ESKD (ESKD group, n = 15), and those with ESKD undergoing cervical epidural anesthesia (ESKD-CEB group, n = 15) were administered propofol by target-controlled infusion (TCI) using the Schneider model. The effect-site concentration (Ce) of propofol started at 0.5 mug/ml and increased in increments of 0.5 mug/ml until the patient did not respond to verbal commands. The relationship between the probability (P) of loss of consciousness and the Ce of propofol was analyzed in each group using logistic regression. The Ce values of propofol at the time of loss of consciousness were 4.3 +/- 0.9, 3.7 +/- 0.9, and 3.3 +/- 1.0 mug/ml for the Control, ESKD, and ESKD-CEB* groups, respectively (*significant difference vs. control, P < 0.05). The estimated Ce50 values for lost ability to respond to verbal command were 4.56, 3.75, and 3.21 mug/ml for the Control, ESKD, and ESKD-CEB groups, respectively. In conclusion, when inducing anesthesia in ESKD patients, we recommend using an initial dose similar to that of patients with normal kidney function, or rather starting with a lower dose.",0.4134791268295780,0,0.08652087317042210,0

38934162,Is It Possible to Predict Systemic Adverse Effects in Subcutaneous Allergen Immunotherapy? Single-Center Experience.,"INTRODUCTION: Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is the oldest and an efficient immunotherapy method that has been used for the treatment of allergic diseases. Systemic adverse effects (SAEs) may occur during the SCIT. For this reason, there may be problems in the continuing treatment. In this study, we primarily aimed to determine the frequency of SAEs, the risk factors that may be associated with SAEs, and clinical and laboratory parameters that can predict systemic reactions in the patients who underwent SCIT. Second, we aimed to evaluate the reasons for discontinuing SCIT and the conditions special to Turkey. METHODS: The files of 295 patients who had received SCIT were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: SCIT was administered against house dust mites (HDM) in almost all patients (n: 291, 98.6%). A total of 14,357 injections were administered to 295 patients included in the study, and 47.8% (n: 141) of the patients discontinued treatment. The most common reason for discontinuing treatment was the supply problem in Turkey for immunotherapy preparations (n: 70, 49.6%). The second reason was that the injection visits were not continued regularly, even though there were no adverse effects related to the treatment (n: 44, 31.2%). SAEs were observed in 16.6% of the patients and 0.66% of the injections. SAEs were more frequent in girls, in asthmatic patients, and in moderate asthmatic patients (p = 0.005, p = 0.016, p = 0.043, respectively). Treatment was terminated in 13 patients (4.4%) due to SAEs. The most common SAE was bronchoconstriction (n: 40, 85.1%). None of our patients developed hypotension or loss of consciousness. Median blood eosinophil count and basophil count and the skin prick test diameter for Dermatophagoides farinae were observed to be significantly higher in the group with SAE (p = 0.024, p = 0.034, p = 0.045, respectively). CONCLUSION: Although SAE may develop in pediatric patients undergoing HDM-specific SCIT, severe reactions are rare. Girls, asthmatic patients, especially moderate asthmatic patients, and patients with high blood eosinophil and basophil levels should be monitored more carefully for the development of SAE.",0.026660366746299600,0,0.47333963325370000,0

35432729,In Silico Identification and Mechanism Exploration of Active Ingredients against Stroke from An-Gong-Niu-Huang-Wan (AGNHW) Formula.,"An-Gong-Niu-Huang-Wan (AGNHW) is a well-known formula for treating cerebrovascular diseases, with roles including clearing away heat, detoxification, and wake-up consciousness. In recent years, AGNHW has been commonly used for the treatment of ischemic stroke, but the mechanism by which AGNHW relieves stroke has not been clearly elucidated. In the current study, we developed a multiple systems pharmacology-based framework to identify the potential antistroke ingredients in AGNHW and explore the underlying mechanisms of action (MOA) of AGNHW against stroke from a holistic perspective. Specifically, we performed a network-based method to identify the potential antistroke ingredients in AGNHW by integrating the drug-target network and stroke-associated genes. Furthermore, the oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model was used to validate the anti-inflammatory effects of the key ingredients by determining the levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. The antiapoptotic effects of the key ingredients were also confirmed in vitro. Integrated pathway analysis of AGNHW revealed that it might regulate three biological signaling pathways, including IL-17, TNF, and PI3K-AKT, to play a protective role in stroke. Moreover, 30 key antistroke ingredients in AGNHW were identified via network-based in silico prediction and were confirmed to have known neuroprotective effects. After drug-like property evaluation and pharmacological validation in vitro, scutellarein (SCU) and caprylic acid (CA) were selected for further antistroke investigation. Finally, systems pharmacology-based analysis of CA and SCU indicated that they might exert antistroke effects via the apoptotic signaling pathway and inflammatory response, which was further validated in an in vitro stroke model. Overall, the current study proposes an integrative systems pharmacology approach to identify antistroke ingredients and demonstrate the underlying pharmacological MOA of AGNHW in stroke, which provides an alternative strategy to investigate novel traditional Chinese medicine formulas for complex diseases.",0.20259029276056700,0,0.2974097072394330,0
37662298,"Ultra-high density electrodes improve detection, yield, and cell type identification in neuronal recordings.","To understand the neural basis of behavior, it is essential to sensitively and accurately measure neural activity at single neuron and single spike resolution. Extracellular electrophysiology delivers this, but it has biases in the neurons it detects and it imperfectly resolves their action potentials. To minimize these limitations, we developed a silicon probe with much smaller and denser recording sites than previous designs, called Neuropixels Ultra (NP Ultra). This device samples neuronal activity at ultra-high spatial density (~10 times higher than previous probes) with low noise levels, while trading off recording span. NP Ultra is effectively an implantable voltage-sensing camera that captures a planar image of a neuron's electrical field. We use a spike sorting algorithm optimized for these probes to demonstrate that the yield of visually-responsive neurons in recordings from mouse visual cortex improves up to ~3-fold. We show that NP Ultra can record from small neuronal structures including axons and dendrites. Recordings across multiple brain regions and four species revealed a subset of extracellular action potentials with unexpectedly small spatial spread and axon-like features. We share a large-scale dataset of these brain-wide recordings in mice as a resource for studies of neuronal biophysics. Finally, using ground-truth identification of three major inhibitory cortical cell types, we found that these cell types were discriminable with approximately 75% success, a significant improvement over lower-resolution recordings. NP Ultra improves spike sorting performance, detection of subcellular compartments, and cell type classification to enable more powerful dissection of neural circuit activity during behavior.",0.5506873215475460,1,0.050687321547545500,1
28289613,Effect of Perioperative Management on Outcome of Patients after Craniosynostosis Surgery.,"BACKGROUND: Craniosynostosis results from premature closure of one or more cranial sutures, leading to deformed calvaria and craniofacial skeleton at birth. Postoperative complications and outcome in intensive care unit (ICU) is related to surgical method and perioperative management. This study determined the perioperative risk factors, which affect outcome of patients after craniosynostosis surgery. METHODS: In a retrospective study, 178 patients with craniosynostosis who underwent primary cranial reconstruction were included. Postoperative complications following neurosurgical procedures including fever in ICU, level of consciousness, re-intubation, and blood, urine, and other cultures were also performed and their association with the main outcomes (length of ICU stay) were analyzed. RESULTS: Factors independently associated with a longer pediatric ICU stay were fever (OR=1.59, 95% CI=1.25-4.32; p=0.001), perioperative bleeding (OR=2.25, 95% CI=1.65-3.65; p=0.01), age (having surgery after the first 5 years) (OR=1.59, 95% CI=1.33-3.54, p=0.016) and infection (OR=2.17, 95% CI=1.83-7.46; p=0.002). Mean blood loss during surgery was significantly higher in patients whose duration of ICU was longer than 4 days compare to less than 4 day (p=0.026). Amount of bleeding significantly was correlated to duration of surgery (r=0.70, p=0.001) and patient's age (r=0.23, p=0.44). CONCLUSION: perioperative management particularly blood loss could deteriorate patients outcome and length of stay in ICU and hospital. Infections in ICU could deteriorate outcomes.",0.24578547250480800,0,0.2542145274951920,0
40087688,"Initial self-reported data on sleep and burnout in pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine: an initiative from the Assembly on Sleep and Respiratory Neurobiology of the American Thoracic Society.","RATIONALE: Health worker burnout has reached crisis proportions, threatening workforce sustainability. Limited data exist on the burden of burnout in pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine (PCCSM), a high-demand and strained specialty. OBJECTIVE: At the Assembly of Sleep and Respiratory Neurobiology of the American Thoracic Society, we aimed to gather exploratory data on burnout in this group. METHODS: During a dedicated series of five virtual town halls (THs), we polled the audience regarding self-reported burnout. Topics included the scope of the problem, role of sleep, impact on clinical and academic operations, contributors in vulnerable groups, and mitigation strategies. RESULTS: A high proportion experienced burnout (45%) and 58% considered premature retirement. Insufficient sleep (53%) was common, most often due to excessive workload (57%) curtailing sleep through early morning meetings and electronic medical record (EMR) documentation. 36% also reported having a sleep disorder. Sleepiness (69%) and fatigue (58%) impaired work performance and patient care, and 54% reported a fatigue-related, personal-safety incident. Contributors to burnout in vulnerable communities included bias/discrimination (81%), harassment (44%) and assault (12%). Respondents predominantly endorsed organizational mitigating strategies: promoting a culture of ""recovery time"" (96%) and healthy sleep (86%), and periodic evaluation and accountability of leadership (86%). CONCLUSIONS: In this convenience sample of participants in a TH series regarding burnout in PCCSM, self-reported burnout was common. Sleep disturbance is a prevalent, under-recognized, but potentially modifiable contributor. The high reported rates of discrimination and harassment suggest that vulnerable groups may be at particular risk. To reduce burnout, system-level interventions aimed at transforming organizational culture and promoting leadership accountability were strongly endorsed.",0.10946716600279900,0,0.39053283399720100,0
27641254,Microsurgical Resection of Cervical Spinal Cord Arteriovenous Malformations: Report of 6 Cases.,"OBJECTIVE: To summarize the experience in microsurgical resection of cervical spinal cord arteriovenous malformation (AVM). METHODS: Six patients undergoing microsurgical resection of cervical intramedullary AVM in the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, China, between March 2005 and March 2015 were reviewed retrospectively, and their clinical manifestations, imaging data, surgical treatment, and results of long-term follow-up were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 6 patients who underwent AVM resection, 2 had compact AVMs and 4 had diffuse AVMs. All 6 patients were reexamined with spinal magnetic resonance imaging within 48 hours after surgery, and 1 patient was examined with digital subtraction angiography. The average patient age was 40.7 +/- 10.4 years (range, 29-60 years). Three patients had chronic onset, of whom 2 developed sensory disturbances and 1 had muscle weakness. The other 3 patients had acute onset, including 1 with sudden quadriplegia, 1 with idiopathic severe headache and altered consciousness, and 1 with idiopathic neck pain. The average duration of follow-up was 48.5 +/- 38.9 months (range, 15-119 months). One patient experienced complete recovery, and the other 5 patients showed improvement. No patient exhibited deterioration. CONCLUSION: Microsurgical resection of cervical intramedullary AVMs has obtained satisfactory clinical results. Preoperative magnetic resonance angiography, computed tomography angiography, and digital subtraction angiography are useful for evaluating the angioarchitecture, which is key to the success of surgery. Intraoperative indocyanine green fluorescence angiography is an important aid in the surgical treatment of spinal AVMs.",0.06752511347630520,0,0.43247488652369500,0

1352254,Membrane stabilizing activity and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist-induced bradycardia in conscious dogs.,"The atrial effective refractory period (AERP) and atrial and ventricular chronotropic effects of the stereoisomers of propranolol, pindolol, metoprolol and penbutolol were studied in conscious atrio-ventricular blocked dogs. Atrial beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity was assessed for all the drugs against isoprenaline. All the drugs except dextro-pindolol lengthened AERP and decreased ventricular rate dose relatedly. At comparable levels of atrial beta-adrenoceptor blockade, dextro-propranolol, dextro-metoprolol and dextro-penbutolol were more potent to induce AERP lengthening than their respective levo-isomers, whereas dextro-pindolol was less potent than levo-pindolol. In addition, levo-pindolol and levo-metoprolol were more potent to produce ventricular bradycardia than the corresponding dextro-isomers, whereas the levo- and dextro-isomers of propranolol and penbutolol were equipotent. These results confirm that the ventricular bradycardia induced by the different beta-adrenoceptor antagonists is partly due to ventricular beta-adrenoceptor blockade and to the membrane stabilizing activity of these drugs, and partly to another as yet unknown factor seen especially with the levo-isomers and particularly marked with metoprolol.",0.054622056512357100,0,0.4453779434876430,0

1898292,Panel on deliberate G-induced loss of consciousness: introduction.,"Over the last decade, G-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) has been recognized as a significant operational problem for pilots of high performance aircraft in both the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy. Consequently, government laboratories have initiated research studies to learn more about the G-LOC phenomenon in an attempt to reduce its hazards. Many of these studies require the occurrence of LOC during their conduct. For this reason, animal models have been developed to use in these studies. However, even though sophisticated animal models such as baboons can be taught to perform tasks before and after G-LOC has occurred, these models have deficiencies that can be overcome only by the use of human volunteers who willingly submit to G-LOC studies on the centrifuge. Such human G-LOC studies began in World War II and continue today. These studies are presently conducted without guidelines regarding subject selection, numbers of G-LOCs allowed per subject per unit time, restraint systems, or specific medical examinations required before, during, and after each episode of LOC, or after each completed study. This panel will discuss what is known about the pathophysiology of G-LOC, the limitations of animal models in these types of studies, the possible medical and psychological sequelae, and the legal implications of conducting deliberate G-LOC research. We hope that the information developed by this panel will be useful to laboratory human-use review committees in determining the requirements and the nature of guidelines for conducting such studies.",0.22510662185283700,0,0.27489337814716300,0
7478263,Lack of evidence for dopamine autoreceptors in the mediobasal hypothalamus: a microdialysis study in awake rats.,"To determine the functional presence of dopamine (DA) autoreceptors on tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA)-ergic neurons in awake rats, a microdialysis probe was implanted into the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH). In the presence of the re-uptake inhibitor nomifensine, which increased DA levels to 350% of basal values, systemic administration of the non-selective D1/D2 antagonist haloperiol induced an immediate increase in DA and DOPAC levels to 145% of pretreatment values. However, neither local infusion of the selective D2 antagonist sulpiride nor of the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 affected the nomifensine-elevated extracellular DA or DOPAC levels in the MBH. Systemic administration of the D2 antagonist raclopride equally did not affect the nomifensine-elevated DA release in the MBH. Upon basal extracellular DA levels (without nomifensine), local infusion of the D2 agonist (-)N-0437 equally did not affect the DA or DOPAC levels in the MBH. Furthermore, the increase in DA levels induced by haloperidol could not be antagonized by the D1 agonist CY 208-243. Therefore, the present study does not provide support for the concept of functional autoreceptors located on TIDA neurons regulating the release of DA. Possibly, the effect of haloperidol was non-DA-ergic in character.",0.11970329173139100,0,0.3802967082686090,0
8042710,Narrative scripts: composing a life with ambition and desire.,"The ""formative and deformative narratives"" and the psychodynamics of male-female relations permeate us all, and are revealed in theme and variations in our consulting rooms. Conventional narrative forms are largely androcentric, action-oriented, and point single-mindedly toward a goal (Van Buren, 1991), whereas women's stories and their identities--digressive and complex weavings--are built around the significant relationships in their lives (Gilligan, 1982; Kaplan, 1984; Bernay, 1986). As clinicians, we must be mindful of derangements of our own desire, shaped by our biological mothers and fathers, our psychoanalytic fathers, Freud, and his early followers, and sometimes our own analysts. We must attend to the voice of our own ambition and trace its flourishes and derailments, understanding female ambition from a woman's point of view in order to assist our patients in reconstructing deformative narratives into healthier and more enabling ones. We need to take responsibility for our own ambition, stilling the disabling voices of the characters in our own intrapsychic dramas, maintaining consciousness of the deformative voices in the culture at large, and attunement to voices of support for ambition integrated with nurturance and aggression.",0.10520019282191300,0,0.394799807178087,0
3050516,Blood glucose levels in Malawian children before and during the administration of intravenous quinine for severe falciparum malaria.,"Hypoglycemia may develop in patients with severe untreated malaria and can complicate the course of treatment with parenteral quinine as a result of quinine-induced hyperinsulinemia. Intravenous quinine is used increasingly as the therapy of choice in patients with severe malaria, most of whom are children. To assess the importance of both pretreatment and quinine-related hypoglycemia in children in an area in which the disease is endemic, we prospectively studied 95 Malawian children with falciparum malaria and altered consciousness who were treated with intravenous quinine. Nineteen patients had hypoglycemia before treatment. Seven (37 percent) died, and five of the survivors (26 percent) had neurologic sequelae. The corresponding values for patients who were initially normoglycemic were 4 percent and 4 percent, respectively (P less than 0.0001). Hypoglycemia was associated with low plasma insulin concentrations and with elevated plasma concentrations of lactate, alanine, and 5'-nucleotidase--a finding that suggests that impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis but not hyperinsulinemia contributes to the pathogenesis of pretreatment hypoglycemia. All patients were given quinine dihydrochloride in a 5 percent dextrose infusion, and those with hypoglycemia received 50 percent dextrose. Hypoglycemia recurred in seven of the patients with pretreatment hypoglycemia, but these episodes were also not associated with hyperinsulinemia. Of the 76 children who were initially normoglycemic, none became hypoglycemic during the course of treatment with intravenous quinine. We conclude that hypoglycemia is a frequent complication of falciparum malaria in children and that it reflects severe disease and is associated with a poor prognosis. We did not find it to be a complication of quinine treatment.",0.05082465239255590,0,0.44917534760744400,0
9591924,Adverse events in phase-I studies: a report in 1015 healthy volunteers.,"OBJECTIVE: This report describes all clinical, laboratory and electrocardiographical adverse events detected in healthy volunteers in a phase-I centre over a 10-year period: 54 phase-I studies are involved, including 1015 healthy young volunteers (993 males) who received 1538 treatments (23 different active drugs or placebo) corresponding to 12143 days of follow-up. This updates a similar report published previously in the European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. METHODS: Adverse events were defined as all events noted in case-report forms. Incidence of adverse events was defined as the ratio between the number of adverse events and the number of follow-up days. Severity was rated as death, life-threatening, severe or minor. Incidences or occurrence rates were compared using the Chi-squared test with Yates' correction. RESULTS: The overall incidence of adverse events was 12.8% with a significant difference between active-drug (13.7%) and placebo (7.9%) treatments. There were 1558 adverse events of 110 distinct kinds. Only for three (headache, diarrhoea and dyspepsia) was the incidence superior to 10 per thousand. Most of these adverse events were also observed with placebo. Ninety-seven percentage of adverse events were of minor intensity; forty three (3%) were rated as severe, including nine worrying cases - six malaises with loss of consciousness, one atrial fibrillation, one hyperthyroidism and one bicytopenia. Some of the adverse events were not related to the tested drugs, but to a vagal reaction or to study conditions. There was no death or life-threatening event. The global rate of occurrence was one adverse event per treatment, one and a half per subject and one out of eight follow-up days. No difference in the overall incidence with placebo was observed between the two successive 5-year periods. CONCLUSIONS: This report confirms that adverse events in phase I studies are very common, usually of minor intensity and rarely severe; even though exceptional, life-threatening adverse events are possible. Adverse events occurring in phase I are rarely published, leading to lack of information. Thus, authors invite clinical research organization (CROs) and phase-I centres to regularly publicise at least severe adverse events; they also suggest that the life-threatening adverse events reported to health authorities should be publicised, for example by the World Health Organization (WHO).",0.0986255459270625,0,0.4013744540729380,0

These can be distinguished from adverse reactions to cannabis, the commonest of which is an acute anxiety state. Acute psychotic episodes can also follow ingestion of the drug but are infrequent. These can be classified as acute confusional states and episodes occurring in clear consciousness. Neither presentation consistently shows enough specific features to warrant the diagnosis of 'cannabis psychosis' as a distinct clinical entity. The evidence that cannabis has a causative role in chronic psychotic or affective disorders is not convincing, although the drug may modify the course of an already established illness. Further controlled studies would be required to clarify the aetiological significance of the drug in these conditions.",0.18526719052269700,0,0.31473280947730300,0
24485039,A trial of intracranial pressure monitoring in traumatic brain injury.,"BACKGROUND: Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is considered the standard of care for severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is used frequently, but the efficacy of treatment based on monitoring in improving the outcome has not been rigorously assessed. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare efficacy of guideline-based management in which a protocol for monitoring intraparenchymal ICP was used (ICP group) or a protocol in which treatment was based on imaging and clinical examination (exam group). DESIGN: A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted. SETTING: The trial was set in ICUs in Bolivia or Ecuador. SUBJECTS: Patients had severe TBI (n = 324) and were 13 years of age or older. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly allocated to ICP monitoring or clinical exam-based monitoring. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was a composite of survival time, impaired consciousness, functional status at 3 and 6 months, and neuropsychological status at 6 months; neuropsychological status was assessed by an examiner who was unaware of the protocol assignment. This composite measure was based on performance across 21 measures of functional and cognitive status and was calculated as a percentile (with 0 indicating the worst performance, and 100 the best performance). RESULTS: There was no significant between-group difference in the primary outcome, a composite measure based on percentile performance across 21 measures of functional and cognitive status (score 56 in the pressure-monitoring group versus 53 in the imaging-clinical examination group; P = 0.49). Six-month mortality rates were 39% in the pressure-monitoring group and 41% in the imaging-clinical examination group (P = 0.60). The median lengths of stay in the ICU were similar in the two groups (12 days in the pressure-monitoring group and 9 days in the imaging-clinical examination group; P = 0.25), although the number of days of brain-specific treatments (for example, administration of hyperosmolar fluids and the use of hyperventilation) in the ICU was higher in the imaging-clinical examination group than in the pressure-monitoring group (4.8 versus 3.4, P = 0.002). The distributions of serious adverse events were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with severe TBI, care focused on maintaining monitored ICP at 20 mmHg or less was not shown to be superior to care based on imaging and clinical examination.",0.12521338676122500,0,0.3747866132387750,0

Their world ranking ranged from 1st to 250th: each had prepared for participation in the Olympic Games. Combining rs-fMRI graph-theoretical and seed-based functional connectivity analyses, it was discovered that the thalamus has its strongest connections with the sensorimotor network in elite swimmers with the highest world rankings (career best rank: 1-35). Strikingly, thalamo-sensorimotor functional connections were highly correlated with the swimmers' motor performance excellence, that is, accounting for 41% of the individual variance in best world ranking.

Here, we demonstrate that these statistical-learning mechanisms can operate at an abstract, conceptual level. In Experiments 1 and 2, observers incidentally learned which semantic categories of natural scenes covaried (e.g., kitchen scenes were always followed by forest scenes). In Experiments 3 and 4, category learning with images of scenes transferred to words that represented the categories. In each experiment, the category of the scenes was irrelevant to the task. Together, these results suggest that statistical-learning mechanisms can operate at a categorical level, enabling generalization of learned regularities using existing conceptual knowledge. Such mechanisms may guide learning in domains as disparate as the acquisition of causal knowledge and the development of cognitive maps from environmental exploration.",0.24936583001857100,0,0.2506341699814290,0

Compared with awake, 1.2 MAC ENF and HAL produced 17% and 18% increases in AV nodal conduction time, respectively. There was little added prolongation related to depth of ENF or HAL. ISO did not prolong AV nodal conduction compared with awake at 1.7 (9%) and 2.3 MAC (12%). All agents produced an approximate 5% increase in His-Purkinje and ventricular conduction times compared with awake, with little additional effect related to depth of anesthesia. In separate experiments in ten of these dogs, anesthetic effects on conduction were determined following combined autonomic blockade with atropine and propranolol. During autonomic blockade, there was no effect of any anesthetic compared with awake, or to increased level of anesthesia, on specialized AV conduction times. The authors conclude that of the major inhalation anesthetics in current clinical use, ISO is least depressant of and ENF and HAL about equally depressant of AV nodal and His-Purkinje conduction times. Furthermore, depression of AV nodal conduction appears to be an indirect rather than direct effect of anesthesia. Finally, most depression of conduction occurs with light anesthesia, with little added depression related to depth of anesthesia over levels likely to be encountered clinically.",0.49605212263748600,0,0.003947877362514230,0
39789422,Acute aortic dissection on CT: is D-dimer determination useful for a timely and correct diagnosis? A case report.,"BACKGROUND: Chest pain is a common reason patients are admitted to the hospital. The most clinically significant cases are those in which the pain is due to an immediate life-threatening condition, such as acute aortic dissection (AAD). A prompt and correct diagnosis is crucial to patient survival. This case report of a patient who presented with chest pain confirms the appropriateness of urgent imaging tests e.g. POCUS when AAD is suspected in high-risk patients, regardless of the results of additional laboratory tests such as the D-dimer (DD) assay. CASE REPORT: A 72-year-old female patient was brought by the emergency medical team to the emergency room due to fainting without loss of consciousness and severe chest pain. Owing to worsening hypotonia and recurrent chest pain, a thoracic computed tomography (CT scan) was performed and subsequently revealed aortic dissection within the ascending segment with bleeding into the pericardial sac. The results of previously ordered laboratory tests, including the DD assay, were unremarkable and were obtained only after the thoracic CT scan had been acquired. Despite prompt medical intervention, the patient died. CONCLUSION: Vigilance is required when diagnosing chest pain in high-risk patients who are suspected of having AAD. The case presented in this report confirms the importance of a thorough history and physical examination as well as prompt diagnostic imaging e.g. POCUS or CT scan. Dedicated laboratory tests such as the DD assay, while often helpful, may fail to reveal remarkable abnormalities in time for medical intervention.",0.3607921347169460,0,0.1392078652830540,0

To determine if the principal acid-reflux characteristics of supine-awake are closer to supine-asleep or upright period. Patients with heartburn underwent an upper endoscopy and pH testing. The patients were instructed to carefully document their upright, supine-awake and supine-asleep periods. A total of 64 patients were enrolled into this study (M/F 35/29; mean age 52.4 +/- 13.3). The mean percentage total time pH <4, frequency of acid-reflux events (per h) and number of sensed reflux events was not different between upright and the supine-awake period (P = ns). In contrast, the mean percentage total time pH <4, frequency of acid-reflux events and number of sensed reflux events was significantly higher in both upright and supine-awake periods vs supine-asleep (4.3 +/- 6.9, 1.86 +/- 2.7 and 0.01 +/- 0.05, P < 0.0001, respectively). The principal characteristics of the acid-reflux events in the supine-awake period are closer to the upright period than to the supine-asleep period.",0.555271213289471,1,0.055271213289471000,0
24659190,Some evidence for unconscious lie detection.,"To maximize survival and reproductive success, primates evolved the tendency to tell lies and the ability to accurately detect them. Despite the obvious advantage of detecting lies accurately, conscious judgments of veracity are only slightly more accurate than chance. However, findings in forensic psychology, neuroscience, and primatology suggest that lies can be accurately detected when less-conscious mental processes (as opposed to more-conscious mental processes) are used. We predicted that observing someone tell a lie would automatically activate cognitive concepts associated with deception, and observing someone tell the truth would activate concepts associated with truth. In two experiments, we demonstrated that indirect measures of deception detection are significantly more accurate than direct measures. These findings provide a new lens through which to reconsider old questions and approach new investigations of human lie detection.",0.21418812049690000,0,0.28581187950310000,0

After taking royal jelly and several other medicinal products, a 33-year-old Japanese male developed severe facial pruritus and erythema, followed by vertigo, numbness in his fingers, generalized pruritus, wheals, dyspnea, wheezing and impaired consciousness. He was treated with corticosteroid and fluid therapy, and his symptoms subsided. Upon allergy testing, his only positive reaction was to royal jelly. Given the clinical symptoms and the positive prick test to royal jelly, a diagnosis of anaphylaxis due to the ingestion of royal jelly was made. In this paper, we describe this case and review the relevant published work.",0.20553281014924400,0,0.29446718985075600,0
15929916,Gelastic seizures due to right temporal cortical dysplasia.,"Gelastic seizures are an uncommon seizure type. They are most frequently observed in patients with hypothalamic hamartoma. Their association with other types of cerebral lesions is rare. Depending on the location of the lesion, gelastic seizures may or may not be accompanied by a subjective feeling of mirth. The pathophysiological mechanisms of this type of seizure are still undefined, and little is known about which pathways promote laughter and its emotional content, mirth. We present a young man with drug-resistant, gelastic seizures due to focal cortical dysplasia of the right inferior temporal gyrus. The lesion was evident on cranial MRI. Interictal EEG displayed a right temporal focus, whereas ictal EEG was not informative. Ictal loss of consciousness precluded reporting of any possible emotional experience. The patient underwent surgical resection of the lesion and has been seizure-free with anti-epileptic medication for two years. Although various anatomical regions may elicit laughter, in view of the current literature it seems that the anterior cingulate region is involved in the motor aspects of laughter, while the basal temporal cortex is involved in the processing of mirth. The fact that the present case exhibited gelastic seizures stresses once more the importance of the baso-lateral temporal cortex in the genesis of this type of seizures.[Published with video sequences].",0.2662516495321910,0,0.2337483504678090,0
29225064,Intracranial high-gamma connectivity distinguishes wakefulness from sleep.,"Neural synchrony in the gamma-band is considered a fundamental process in cortical computation and communication and it has also been proposed as a crucial correlate of consciousness. However, the latter claim remains inconclusive, mainly due to methodological limitations, such as the spectral constraints of scalp-level electroencephalographic recordings or volume-conduction confounds. Here, we circumvented these caveats by comparing gamma-band connectivity between two global states of consciousness via intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), which provides the most reliable measurements of high-frequency activity in the human brain. Non-REM Sleep recordings were compared to passive-wakefulness recordings of the same duration in three subjects with surgically implanted electrodes. Signals were analyzed through the weighted Phase Lag Index connectivity measure and relevant graph theory metrics. We found that connectivity in the high-gamma range (90-120 Hz), as well as relevant graph theory properties, were higher during wakefulness than during sleep and discriminated between conditions better than any other canonical frequency band. Our results constitute the first report of iEEG differences between wakefulness and sleep in the high-gamma range at both local and distant sites, highlighting the utility of this technique in the search for the neural correlates of global states of consciousness.",0.15525362032036900,0,0.34474637967963100,0
39906467,Multiple Subcutaneous Metastases in Endometrial Cancer Treated With Systemic Chemotherapy: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.,"Subcutaneous metastasis of endometrial cancer (EC) is an exceedingly rare phenomenon, and the mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis remain insufficiently elucidated. We report the case of a 69-year-old multiparous woman diagnosed with stage IB EC, histologically classified as grade 3 endometrioid and clear cell carcinoma. Approximately one month following primary surgical intervention, the patient developed subcutaneous masses on her back, axilla, and buttock. Histopathological evaluation, in conjunction with PET-CT, confirmed a systemic recurrence of EC. She was subsequently treated with a combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin, with a remarkable therapeutic response; after six cycles of chemotherapy, nearly all metastatic sites exhibited complete resolution. She was then transitioned to a regimen of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab. However, one week after the initiation of this treatment, she developed hepatic encephalopathy, which was presumed to be lenvatinib-induced, and was successfully managed with aminoleban injections, resulting in a full recovery of consciousness. Follow-up diagnostic imaging confirmed a complete response to therapy. The patient is currently receiving pembrolizumab as maintenance therapy and has remained recurrence-free for 18 months. While no standardized therapeutic protocol exists for the management of subcutaneous metastasis in EC due to its extremely low incidence, this report provides evidence for the potential efficacy of chemotherapy combined with targeted immunotherapy in the treatment of unresectable subcutaneous metastases in EC.",0.3637257882911030,0,0.1362742117088970,0
34093900,"Anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor Encephalitis Associated with Ovarian Teratoma in South China-Clinical Features, Treatment, Immunopathology, and Surgical Outcomes of 21 Cases.","OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of anti-NMDAR encephalitis and the immunopathology of associated teratomas. METHODS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled in this retrospective study, who were diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis with ovarian teratoma and admitted to two tertiary hospitals in South China from July 2014 to December 2019. The clinical data of patients were reviewed. Comparisons were made between the patients with different outcomes after surgery. Immunohistochemical analyses of associated ovarian teratomas were performed. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 24.33 +/- 5.12 years. The peak seasons of disease onset were autumn and winter (30.61% and 32.65%). The symptoms could be divided into 8 categories, including psychiatric abnormalities, seizures, movement dysfunction, consciousness disorders, autonomic dysregulation, speech disturbance, central hypoventilation, and memory deficits. All patients developed four or more categories of symptoms within the first four weeks. Twelve patients (57.1%) had a maximum mRS of 5, and 11 patients (52.4%) were admitted to ICU. Twenty patients received surgery, and only 3 patients were diagnosed pathologically with immature ovarian teratomas, while the other 17 patients had mature ovarian teratomas. After surgery, 17 patients (85.0%) got clinical improvement. The central hypoventilation symptom and mature ovarian teratomas were associated with surgical outcome. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that there were NMDAR-positive neural tissues in all 8 teratomas and in which 3 cases also contained large numbers of NMDAR-positive sebaceous glands and squamous epithelial tissues. CONCLUSION: The disease is of high prevalence in autumn and winter. The central hypoventilation symptom and mature ovarian teratomas were associated with surgical outcome. NMDAR-positive neural tissue is not the only etiological factor of encephalitis. We speculate that encephalitis development in some patients may result from NMDAR expression in sebaceous glands and squamous epithelial tissues.",0.02925708712887220,0,0.4707429128711280,0
2707220,Cigarette smokers do more than just smoke cigarettes.,"In this study, we hypothesized that light and moderate-to-heavy cigarette smokers, when compared with nonsmokers, would exhibit significantly less healthy attitudes and behaviors on several dimensions relevant to the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). A factor analysis of survey items measuring knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors in five CHD risk areas produced four major factors, which we labeled Attitudes (Factor 1), Health Consciousness (Factor 2), Knowledge (Factor 3), and Unhealthy Behaviors (Factor 4). Factor-based scales generated for each of these four factors were used in a one-way multivariate analysis of variance to examine differences between nonsmokers, light smokers, and moderate-to-heavy smokers. Cigarette smokers versus nonsmokers exhibited less positive attitudes toward CHD risk behaviors, whereas moderate-to-heavy cigarette smokers, as compared with the light smokers and the nonsmokers, exhibited lower levels of health consciousness and enacted unhealthy behaviors at a greater frequency. The moderate-to-heavy cigarette smokers also exhibited a lower commitment to enact healthy behavioral changes in the immediate future, even after corrections were introduced for their lower frequency of healthy behaviors during the past week. Overall, these results support our hypothesis that cigarette smokers, particularly as they become more involved with cigarette smoking, do more than just smoke cigarettes; they exhibit a less healthy lifestyle as shown by cognitive, behavioral, and motivational dimensions related to cardiovascular health.",0.10080560346052600,0,0.3991943965394740,0
16573416,Neurologic complications of critical illness: part I. Altered states of consciousness and metabolic encephalopathies.,"OBJECTIVE: To review the metabolic encephalopathies and neuromuscular abnormalities commonly found in the critically ill patient in a two-part presentation. DATA SOURCES: A review of articles reported from 1980 to 2002 and identified through a MEDLINE search on metabolic encephalopathy, polyneuropathy and myopathy in critical illness. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: An alteration in the conscious state can be caused by space occupying lesions or infections of the central nervous system. However, in the critically ill patient a metabolic encephalopathy is often the cause of an acute confusional state or a reduced state of consciousness. There is no specific treatment for the metabolic encephalopathies as they commonly resolve when the underlying disorders (e.g. sepsis, renal failure, hepatic failure, electrolyte disturbance) are corrected. Management may also require judicious pharmacological and/or physical restraint in the case of the acute confusional states and ensuring an adequate airway, ventilation and circulation in the case of a reduced state of consciousness, while the underlying disorder is corrected and the encephalopathy resolves. CONCLUSIONS: In the critically ill patient a metabolic encephalopathy is commonly the cause of confusion, disorientation, agitation, drowsiness or coma. Sedative agents and tranquilisers may be required as well as management of the airway, ventilation and circulation while the underlying disorder is corrected to allow the encephalopathy to resolve.",0.41273293593475700,0,0.08726706406524330,0
9743960,Cerebellar mutism syndrome.,"Since 1980, a growing number of pediatric patients with mutism following posterior fossa surgery have been recognized. This syndrome typically affects children and in rare cases young adults who become mute one or two days after tumor operation but do not show disturbances of consciousness or language comprehension. The disorder persists for 1 to 4 months. The pathogenesis is still unknown. Of 21 children who underwent surgery for large posterior fossa tumors between 1991 and 1995, 6 developed cerebellar mutism. Histologically the tumors were classified as astrocytoma WHO grade I, astrocytoma WHO grade II and ependymoma WHO grade III in one case and medulloblastoma WHO grade IV in three cases. Besides the clinical course, intraoperative findings and CT or MRI data are evaluated and discussed considering possible etiological hypotheses. Our own experience and also literature reviews suggest that the lesion of the cerebellar hemispheres might be the most important one of multiple factors causing cerebellar mutism. Generally the syndrome is transient. The diagnosis should not delay adjuvant therapy in patients with a malignancy.",0.04440239463033710,0,0.4555976053696630,0
38721996,The role of visuomotor synchrony on virtual full-body illusions in children and adults.,"The present study explored the effects of visuomotor synchrony in virtual reality during the embodiment of a full human avatar in children (aged 5-6 years) and adults. Participants viewed their virtual bodies from a first-person perspective while they moved the body during self-generated and structured movement. Embodiment was measured via questions and psychophysiological responses (skin conductance) to a virtual body-threat and during both movement conditions. Both children and adults had increased feelings of ownership and agency over a virtual body during synchronous visuomotor feedback (compared to asynchronous visuomotor feedback). Children had greater ownership compared to adults during synchronous movement but did not differ from adults on agency. There were no differences in SCRs (frequency or magnitude) between children and adults, between conditions (i.e., baseline or movement conditions) or visuomotor feedback. Collectively, the study highlights the importance of visuomotor synchrony for children's ratings of embodiment for a virtual avatar from at least 5 years old, and suggests adults and children are comparable in terms of psychophysiological arousal when moving (or receiving a threat to) a virtual body. This has important implications for our understanding of the development of embodied cognition and highlights the considerable promise of exploring visuomotor VR experiences in children.",0.08683174839700780,0,0.41316825160299200,0
33603273,Effect of Therapeutic Hypothermia on Liver Enzymes in Patients With Stroke.,"INTRODUCTION: A promising strategy that can lead to longer brain cell survival after an acute stroke is therapeutic hypothermia. It represents a controlled decrease in body temperature for therapeutic reasons. It is increasingly represented as a therapeutic option and is one of the most challenging treatments that improves neurological recovery and treatment outcome in patients with acute stroke. AIM: To examine the effect of therapeutic hypothermia on liver enzymes in patients with diagnosis of stroke. METHODS: A total of 101 patients diagnosed with acute stroke were treated. The first group (n=40) were treated with conventional treatment and therapeutic hypothermia, while the second group (n=61) only with conventional treatment. Cooling of the body to a target body temperature of 34 degrees C to 35 degrees C was performed for up to 24 hours. Outcome (survival or death) of treatment was monitored, degree of disability was determined by National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and assessment of consciousness using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values were taken at admission, after 24 hours, and were monitored upon discharge. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in AST values at admission relative to disease outcome (p = 0.002), as well as for ALT (p = 0.008). In patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia, mean AST values decreased after 24 hours (32.50 to 31.00 IU/mL) as well as ALT values (27.50 to 26.50 IU/mL), without statistical significance. In the group of subjects who survived with sequela, AST values correlated with GCS (rho = -0.489; p = 0.002) and NIHSS (rho = 0.492; p = 0.003), ALT values correlated with GCS (rho = -0.356; p = 0.03) but not with NIHSS. CONCLUSION: AST and ALT values at admission correlate with the severity of the clinical picture. Therapeutic hypothermia is hepatoprotective and lowers AST and ALT values.",0.05528533292026550,0,0.4447146670797350,0
38791840,Health-Related Lifestyles among University Students: Focusing on Eating Habits and Physical Activity.,"The transition to higher education at University is a critical moment for young adults to acquire unhealthy habits regarding physical activity (PA) and adherence to a healthy diet. Negative behaviors might be maintained in the years to come with a major risk of suffering from a Non-Communicable Disease. This study aims to determine the relationship between diet and PA in the student community of University of Milano-Bicocca. Students between 18 and 30 years old completed an online survey (6949 students). Two analyses of covariance (ANCOVA), chi-square tests of independence, and a binomial logistic regression were performed to examine the relationship between adequacy of food consumption and PA, in association also with sociodemographic characteristics. Data show a strong correlation between behaviors analyzed, with a proportional positive association between PA and healthy diet. Nevertheless, a third of the sample students incur in incorrect habits for both diet and PA. Further, students performing intensive PA have the healthiest food consumption in general but the worst red meat and pork intake. Accordingly, men practice more PA but have a less adequate diet, exactly contrary to women. In conclusion, policies promoting consciousness of well-being would transform Universities into healthy hubs for virtuous habits.",0.07398232581570250,0,0.42601767418429800,0
32938812,[An Intraabdominal Hemorrhage Affected by Catecholamine Surges Caused by Subarachnoid Hemorrhage:A Case Report].,"Intraabdominal hemorrhage is a rare complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage(SAH). Recently, there have been a number of reports about the coexistence of intracranial and Intraabdominal aneurysms caused by segmental arterial mediolysis(SAM). The etiology of SAM is still unclear, but catecholamine is known to be one of the causes of SAM. The authors report a rare case in which an increase of catecholamine by SAH affected the Intraabdominal hemorrhage during the perioperative period of SAH. A 67-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with SAH. Cerebral angiography revealed a right internal carotid-posterior communicating artery aneurysm, and an emergent neck clipping was performed. The intraoperative finding was a saccular aneurysm with a partial red wall of the internal carotid artery. Thirteen days after SAH, the patient complained of abdominal pain, but there were no particular findings on abdominal CT. The next day, anemia progressed suddenly because of Intraabdominal hemorrhage caused by rupture of the splenic artery aneurysm. She developed shock and consciousness disturbance, and left hemiparesis due to vasospasm appeared. She recovered from shock after receiving transfusion and coil embolization of the splenic artery aneurysm. Her consciousness and left hemiparesis improved after two months of rehabilitation. The radiological findings of the splenic artery aneurysm are compatible with SAM. We believe that an increase in catecholamine by SAH affected the development and rupture of the splenic artery aneurysm. In cases of SAH with abdominal pain, a detailed examination of the abdomen might be needed, and the use of catecholamine for symptomatic vasospasm should be carefully performed.",0.17364525577954200,0,0.3263547442204580,0
38732339,Examination of Cardiac Activity with ECG Monitoring Using Heart Rate Variability Methods.,"The paper presents a system for analyzing cardiac activity with the possibility of continuous and remote monitoring. The created sensor mobile device monitors heart activity by means of the convenient and imperceptible registration of cardiac signals. At the same time, the behavior of the human body is also monitored through the accelerometer and gyroscope built into the device, thanks to which it is possible to signal in the event of loss of consciousness or fall (in patients with syncope). Conducting real-time cardio monitoring and the analysis of recordings using various mathematical methods (linear, non-linear, and graphical) enables the research, accurate diagnosis, timely assistance, and correct treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The paper examines the recordings of patients diagnosed with arrhythmia and syncope recorded by electrocardiography (ECG) sensors in real conditions. The obtained results are subjected to statistical analysis to determine the accuracy and significance of the obtained results. The studies show significant deviations in the patients with arrhythmia and syncope regarding the obtained values of the studied parameters of heart rate variability (HRV) from the accepted normal values (for example, the root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats (RMSSD) in healthy individuals is 24.02 ms, while, in patients with arrhythmia (6.09 ms) and syncope (5.21 ms), it is much lower). The obtained quantitative and graphic results identify some possible abnormalities and demonstrate disorders regarding the activity of the autonomic nervous system, which is directly related to the work of the heart.",0.44373624614799100,0,0.056263753852009000,0
22387511,An early onset rehabilitation program for children and adolescents after traumatic brain injury (TBI): Methods and first results.,"Survived traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are one of the most serious challenges to the patient's future life. Recent literature increasingly questions the long believed protective effects of functional cerebral plasticity in children. Although TBI in children and adolescents is frequent, they are less frequently admitted to rehabilitation centers as in-patients than adults. This emphasizes the role of out-patient treatment. The progressing study described here aims to achieve a contribution to a comprehensive approach in TBI-rehabilitation for youngsters. A two-stage multimethodal program, starting with stimulation in coma while the patient is on the intensive care unit, and neuropsychological therapy after regaining consciousness is to be evaluated in a controlled, prospective and randomized study. After including nearly 50 % of the planned sample (100 persons), some preliminary results can be mentioned with all applicable caution. The effectiveness of the applied therapy can be stated here with respect to the posttraumatic development of intellectual abilities in the 6- and 12 months follow ups. Moreover, in the control group development of psychopathological alterations was found to a considerable degree and also lower ratings in a quality of life questionnaire, compared to the experimental group. It is expected to prove these differences statistically, after the total sample has been included, and thus equal distributions have been achieved in all predictive variables.",0.3761638062987370,0,0.12383619370126300,0
35262872,A missed psoas abscess diagnosis: A forensic case report.,"Psoas abscess is a rare pathology that usually presents with non-specific signs and rare clinical features. These characteristics can delay the diagnosis leading to complications and death. We report a forensic autopsy case of a 65-year-old male, alcoholic, smoker, with a history of hypertension, and urinary infection, who presented to the emergency room for anorexia and consciousness disorder. On physical examination, the patient was febrile and confused. Laboratory exams revealed leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Two days later, he died despite extensive resuscitation. Forensic autopsy revealed a large amount of green pus in the left psoas muscle extending to the muscles of the thigh of the same side with multiple cavities. The pus extended to the left kidney with destructive parenchyma and coralliform lithiasis. Histological examination showed destroyed renal tissue by lesions of chronic and acute pyelonephritis with dilatation of the pyelocaliceal cavities. Bacteriological analysis of the pus showed the presence of Escherichia coli. The psoas abscess was secondary to pyonephrosis favored by the immunodeficiency. Thus, death was attributed to a septic shock secondary to a psoas abscess complicating pyonephrosis.",0.1737022027777910,0,0.3262977972222090,0
25967083,Stimulating the aberrant brain: Evidence for increased cortical hyperexcitability from a transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) study of individuals predisposed to anomalous perceptions.,"Findings from neurological and clinical groups have shown that increased predisposition to anomalous experience/aura reflects an elevation in aberrant neural processes in the brain. However, studies of anomalous experiences in non-clinical/non-neurological groups are less clear on this matter and are more typically confined to subjective questionnaire measures alone. The current investigation, the first to our knowledge, carried out a transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) study of cortical hyperexcitability, and its association with anomalous experience in non-clinical/non-neurological groups. Sixty participants completed; (i) both excitatory (anodal) and inhibitory (cathodal) brain stimulation conditions of the visual cortex; (ii) a computerised pattern-glare task, where observers reported phantom visual distortions from viewing highly irritable visual patterns (a metric of cortical hyperexcitability), and; (iii) questionnaire measures of predisposition to anomalous perceptions. There were no reliable signs of cortical hyperexcitability (via pattern-glare tasks) when collapsed across the whole sample. However, a significant positive correlation between predisposition to anomalous experience and elevated signs of cortical hyperexcitability was observed. Crucially, there was a significant negative correlation between tDCS stimulatory conditions. A visual cortex that reacted more strongly to excitatory stimulation, responded less well to inhibitory suppression, and this pattern was related to predisposition to anomalous perceptions. Both findings are consistent with the presence of a hyperexcitable cortex. Collectively the present findings provide objective evidence that the brains of individuals predisposed to anomalous experiences/hallucinations can be hyperexcitable - even in the non-clinical/non-neurological population. These data are consistent with continuum models of anomalous experience and have important implications for contemporary theories of aberrations in self-consciousness.",0.24626821040080800,0,0.25373178959919200,0
19589132,Infarction in the territory of the anterior cerebral artery: clinical study of 51 patients.,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about clinical features and prognosis of patients with ischaemic stroke caused by infarction in the territory of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA). This single centre, retrospective study was conducted with the following objectives: a) to describe the clinical characteristics and short-term outcome of stroke patients with ACA infarction as compared with that of patients with ischaemic stroke due to middle cerebral artery (MCA) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) infarctions, and b) to identify predictors of ACA stroke. METHODS: Fifty-one patients with ACA stroke were included in the ""Sagrat Cor Hospital of Barcelona Stroke Registry"" during a period of 19 years (1986-2004). Data from stroke patients are entered in the stroke registry following a standardized protocol with 161 items regarding demographics, risk factors, clinical features, laboratory and neuroimaging data, complications and outcome. The characteristics of these 51 patients with ACA stroke were compared with those of the 1355 patients with MCA infarctions and 232 patients with PCA infarctions included in the registry. RESULTS: Infarctions of the ACA accounted for 1.3% of all cases of stroke (n = 3808) and 1.8% of cerebral infarctions (n = 2704). Stroke subtypes included cardioembolic infarction in 45.1% of patients, atherothrombotic infarction in 29.4%, lacunar infarct in 11.8%, infarct of unknown cause in 11.8% and infarction of unusual aetiology in 2%. In-hospital mortality was 7.8% (n = 4). Only 5 (9.8%) patients were symptom-free at hospital discharge. Speech disturbances (odds ratio [OR] = 0.48) and altered consciousness (OR = 0.31) were independent variables of ACA stroke in comparison with MCA infarction, whereas limb weakness (OR = 9.11), cardioembolism as stroke mechanism (OR = 2.49) and sensory deficit (OR = 0.35) were independent variables associated with ACA stroke in comparison with PCA infarction. CONCLUSION: Cardioembolism is the main cause of brain infarction in the territory of the ACA. Several clinical features are more frequent in stroke patients with ACA infarction than in patients with ischaemic stroke due to infarction in the MCA and PCA territories.",0.03508309666671740,0,0.4649169033332830,0
26290126,How are different neural networks related to consciousness?,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the roles of different resting-state networks in predicting both the actual level of consciousness and its recovery in brain injury patients. METHODS: We investigated resting-state functional connectivity within different networks in patients with varying levels of consciousness: unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS; n = 56), minimally conscious state (MCS; n = 29), and patients with brain lesions but full consciousness (BL; n = 48). Considering the actual level of consciousness, we compared the strength of network connectivity among the patient groups. We then checked the presence of connections between specific regions in individual patients and calculated the frequency of this in the different patient groups. Considering the recovery of consciousness, we split the UWS group into 2 subgroups according to recovery: those who emerged from UWS (UWS-E) and those who remained in UWS (UWS-R). The above analyses were repeated on these 2 subgroups. RESULTS: Functional connectivity strength in salience network (SN), especially connectivity between the supragenual anterior cingulate cortex (SACC) and left anterior insula (LAI), was reduced in the unconscious state (UWS) compared to the conscious state (MCS and BL). Moreover, at the individual level, SACC-LAI connectivity was more present in MCS than in UWS. Default-mode network (DMN) connectivity strength, especially between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and left lateral parietal cortex (LLPC), was reduced in UWS-R compared with UWS-E. Furthermore, PCC-LLPC connectivity was more present in UWS-E than in UWS-R. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that SN (SACC-LAI) connectivity correlates with behavioral signs of consciousness, whereas DMN (PCC-LLPC) connectivity instead predicts recovery of consciousness.",0.6719981962952640,1,0.17199819629526400,1
26137969,Comparison of Bispectral Index and Entropy values with electroencephalogram during surgical anaesthesia with sevoflurane.,"BACKGROUND: Concomitantly recorded Bispectral Index(R) (BIS) and Entropy values sometimes show discordant trends during general anaesthesia. Previously, no attempt had been made to discover which EEG characteristics cause discrepancies between BIS and Entropy. We compared BIS and Entropy values, and analysed the changes in the raw EEG signal during surgical anaesthesia with sevoflurane. METHODS: In this prospective, open-label study, 65 patients receiving general anaesthesia with sevoflurane were enrolled. BIS, Entropy and multichannel digital EEG were recorded. Concurrent BIS and State Entropy (SE) values were selected. Whenever BIS and SE values showed >/=10-unit disagreement for >/=60 s, the raw EEG signal was analysed both in time and frequency domain. RESULTS: A >/=10-unit disagreement >/=60 s was detected 428 times in 51 patients. These 428 episodes accounted for 5158 (11%) out of 45 918 analysed index pairs. During EEG burst suppression, SE was higher than BIS in 35 out of 49 episodes. During delta-theta dominance, BIS was higher than SE in 141 out of 157 episodes. During alpha or beta activity, SE was higher than BIS in all 49 episodes. During electrocautery, both BIS and SE changed, sometimes in the opposite direction, but returned to baseline values after electrocautery. Electromyography caused index disagreement four times (BIS > SE). CONCLUSIONS: Certain specific EEG patterns, and artifacts, are associated with discrepancies between BIS and SE. Time and frequency domain analyses of the original EEG improve the interpretation of studies involving BIS, Entropy and other EEG-based indices.

2784050,Failure of cimetidine prophylaxis in neurosurgery.,"Three hundred and eight-one patients who underwent major neurosurgical procedures were given cimetidine prophylaxis against stress ulceration. Nine patients (2.4%) developed acute gastrointestinal complications; two patients had perforation and bleeding from gastroduodenal ulcers, and seven patients had bleeding alone. Six of these patients, all above the age of 70 years, died as a consequence of the complication. Univariate analysis showed that four variables--state of consciousness, syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, nature of surgery, and age--were significant factors in predicting cimetidine failure. Multivariate analysis revealed that a patient's pre-operative state of consciousness and the presence of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone were of independent significance in predicting cimetidine failure. The risk was 52% and 0.07%, respectively, when both factors were either present or absent.",0.026749995463486300,0,0.47325000453651400,0
21273423,Expectations change the signatures and timing of electrophysiological correlates of perceptual awareness.,"Previous experience allows the brain to predict what comes next. How these expectations affect conscious experience is poorly understood. In particular, it is unknown whether and when expectations interact with sensory evidence in granting access to conscious perception, and how this is reflected electrophysiologically. Here, we parametrically manipulate sensory evidence and expectations while measuring event-related potentials in human subjects to assess the time course of evoked responses that correlate with subjective visibility, the properties of the stimuli, and/or perceptual expectations. We found that expectations lower the threshold of conscious perception and reduce the latency of neuronal signatures differentiating seen and unseen stimuli. Without expectations, this differentiation occurs approximately 300 ms and with expectations approximately 200 ms after stimulus in occipitoparietal sensors. The amplitude of this differentiating response component (P2) decreases as visibility increases, regardless of whether this increase is attributable to enhanced sensory evidence and/or the gradual buildup of perceptual expectations. Importantly, at matched performance levels, responses to seen and unseen stimuli differed regardless of the physical stimulus properties. These findings indicate that the latency of the neuronal correlates of access to consciousness depend on whether access is driven by stimulus saliency or by a combination of expectations and sensory evidence.",0.23612061852653400,0,0.26387938147346600,0
32208843,Stroke Prognostic Scores and Data-Driven Prediction of Clinical Outcomes After Acute Ischemic Stroke.,"Background and Purpose- Several stroke prognostic scores have been developed to predict clinical outcomes after stroke. This study aimed to develop and validate novel data-driven predictive models for clinical outcomes by referring to previous prognostic scores in patients with acute ischemic stroke in a real-world setting. Methods- We used retrospective data of 4237 patients with acute ischemic stroke who were hospitalized in a single stroke center in Japan between January 2012 and August 2017. We first validated point-based stroke prognostic scores (preadmission comorbidities, level of consciousness, age, and neurological deficit [PLAN] score, ischemic stroke predictive risk score [IScore], and acute stroke registry and analysis of Lausanne [ASTRAL] score in all patients; Houston intraarterial recanalization therapy [HIAT] score, totaled health risks in vascular events [THRIVE] score, and stroke prognostication using age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale-100 [SPAN-100] in patients who received reperfusion therapy) in our cohort. We then developed predictive models using all available data by linear regression or decision tree ensembles (random forest and gradient boosting decision tree) and evaluated their area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for clinical outcomes after repeated random splits. Results- The mean (SD) age of the patients was 74.7 (12.9) years and 58.3% were men. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (95% CIs) of prognostic scores in our cohort were 0.92 PLAN score (0.90-0.93), 0.86 for IScore (0.85-0.87), 0.85 for ASTRAL score (0.83-0.86), 0.69 for HIAT score (0.62-0.75), 0.70 for THRIVE score (0.64-0.76), and 0.70 for SPAN-100 (0.63-0.76) for poor functional outcomes, and 0.87 for PLAN score (0.85-0.90), 0.88 for IScore (0.86-0.91), and 0.88 ASTRAL score (0.85-0.91) for in-hospital mortality. Internal validation of data-driven prediction models showed that their area under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranged between 0.88 and 0.94 for poor functional outcomes and between 0.84 and 0.88 for in-hospital mortality. Ensemble models of a decision tree tended to outperform linear regression models in predicting poor functional outcomes but not in predicting in-hospital mortality. Conclusions- Stroke prognostic scores perform well in predicting clinical outcomes after stroke. Data-driven models may be an alternative tool for predicting poststroke clinical outcomes in a real-world setting.",0.05444493086607490,0,0.44555506913392500,0
783025,A controlled study of the EEG during transcendental meditation: comparison with hypnosis.,"A controlled, quantitative investigation of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and transcendental meditation (TM) revealed that EEG changes during TM were rarely as pronounced or consistent as previous reports suggest. There was considerable variation between subjects, some displaying no EEG changes at all during TM compared with an equal period of non-meditation. Any changes that did occur in a particular individual were not necessarily repeated in a subsequent session. A comparison of mean EEG parameters of the experimental group revealed no consistent significant differences between meditation and non-meditation, although trends towards increased theta and decreased beta activity during meditation were apparent. The biggest differences in mean EEG parameters were between subject groups. In particular, the group of meditators exhibited significantly more theta activity (during both TM and non-meditation) than a randomly selected group of individuals that had never meditated or been hypnotized. The EEG characteristics of the group of meditators were similar to those of a group of subjects experienced in self-hypnosis. It is concluded that the most obvious EEG changes during meditation are long-term. In people who regularly practise TM (or self-hypnosis), the EEG gradually (over weeks or months) tends to ""slow down."" Such a ""slowed down"" EEG is apparent during both normal waking conditions and altered states of consciousness in these individuals.",0.15838962495319500,0,0.34161037504680500,0

37583535,"The Electroencephalographic Brainwave Spectrum, Mindful Meditation, and Awareness: Hypothesis.","It is hypothesized that being mindfully aware is a spontaneous state of being. It is imbued with joy, peace and happiness. Such a state is periodically revealed during restful attentiveness or presence. It is also associated with spontaneous brain alpha activity of 8-13 Hz. In deep nonrapid eye movement sleep, there is synchronous delta activity at a coherent frequency of 0.1 Hz. Both of these brainwave ground states are spontaneous, calm and effortless. When any physical or mental effort is made, the alpha rhythm is desynchronized, and it is superposed by faster brain waves of beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma frequencies (30-150 Hz). This is associated with a stream of dualistic conscious experiences with contents. During deep sleep, delta activity is superposed by beta and gamma activity with microarousals resulting in dream experiences. During effortless, meditative awareness, the whole family of alpha rhythm is synchronized including (a) Occipital-parietal alpha with visual clarity, formless color, and the absence of visual imagery (b) Frontal eye-field alpha with relatively motionless eyes, and the absence of voluntary actions or plans to move the eyes in some direction, along with nonactive working memory, (c) Somatosensory alpha or Mu rhythm from the somatic motor-sensory cortex with the resultant stillness of the body including head, face, larynx, spine, hands and legs, (d) Mid-temporal auditory alpha with vocal quietness and internal verbal silence (Maunam) with a feeling of spontaneous silence and serenity, (e) Cingulate and precuneus alpha resulting in freedom from autobiographical memories and the sense of agency or ego. The insular cortex serves as a gatekeeper, a hierarchical controller to switch between conscious engagement or disengagement from the internal or the external world. It switches between the default mode network and the executive frontoparietal networks, between the sequential and the parallel modes of functioning. Mindful consciousness is local and dualistic, whereas mindful awareness is nonlocal and nondual.",0.5962892411854890,1,0.0962892411854891,1
37601786,Effect of analgesia nociception index monitor-based nociception control on perioperative stress responses during laparoscopic surgery in Trendelenburg position: a randomized controlled trial.,"INTRODUCTION: The analgesia nociception index (ANI) monitor is a nociception monitoring device based on heart rate variability. We aimed to determine the effect of ANI monitor-based intraoperative nociception control on the perioperative stress response during laparoscopic surgery in the Trendelenburg position. METHODS: Altogether, 72 female patients who underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy were randomized to either the control or ANI group. Intraoperative nociception was controlled by remifentanil administration in a conventional manner (based on blood pressure and heart rate) in the control group and by ANI monitoring in the ANI group. Perioperative stress responses were estimated by measuring the levels of serum catecholamines and catabolic stress hormones at three timepoints: after loss of consciousness, at the end of surgery, and 1 h after the end of surgery. RESULTS: The serum cortisol level at the end of surgery was significantly higher in the ANI group than in the control group (p < 0.001), although more remifentanil was administered in the ANI group than in the control group (p < 0.001). Changes in the other estimators' levels were comparable between groups during the perioperative period. The hemodynamic profiles during surgery were also significantly different between the two groups. Phenylephrine use to treat hypotension was more common in the ANI group than in the control group (p = 0.005). However, postoperative clinical outcomes such as pain and nausea/vomiting did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: ANI monitor-based nociception control in laparoscopic surgery in the Trendelenburg position did not improve perioperative stress responses, intraoperative opioid consumption, or postoperative clinical outcomes.Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04343638).",0.37816417314501300,0,0.12183582685498700,0

Patients with cardiac syncope have a substantial risk of subsequent sudden death.

This study examined how the sense of control influences people's perception of sensorimotor input under the framework of categorical perception. Twenty human participants (18 males, two females) took part in both experiments. Experiment 1 showed that the sensitivity (d') of detecting a 20% change in control from no change was higher when the changes occurred at the control-category boundary than within each category. Experiment 2 showed that the control categories greatly affected early attention allocation, even when the judgment of control was unnecessary to the task. Taken together, these results showed that our perceptual and cognitive systems are highly sensitive to small changes in control that build up to a determinant change in the control category within a relatively narrow boundary zone between categories, compared with a continuous, gradual physical change in control.",0.3198399738482030,0,0.18016002615179700,0

A thematic analysis of students' experiences in a novel virtual environment.,"Research on consciousness typically presents stimuli and records the responses that follow, to infer the intervening processes. Yet, VR allows ecological validity by giving the user freedom to continuously control their sensory input across three spatial dimensions via head and eye movement. We designed a virtual world in which the angle of view relates to the information complexity of the sensory input. We assessed its acceptability and feasibility, and explored the first-person experience. Ten university students were immersed in two different novel environments, then a semi-structured interview, guided by first-person video footage of the VR experience, elicited participants' reports. The methodology proved feasible, and a thematic analysis was consistent with Mansell's (2024) control theory perspective, and to a lesser degree, Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT). We conclude that novel virtual environments provide an accessible, dynamic and valid way to gather evidence regarding different theories of consciousness.",0.32821832283123300,0,0.17178167716876700,1
8668562,Reframing women's health in nursing education: a feminist approach.,"To operate from a feminist paradigm is a new way of thinking for nurse educators. Feminist perspectives in nursing provide a new stage of consciousness--one that values women's voices, their way of knowing, and their life experiences, and, most important, one that challenges traditional patriarchal practices. Furthermore, nursing curricula with feminist perspectives provides a biopsychosocial approach that encourages the full recognition of variables that can influence women's health, such as socioeconomic status, racial and ethnic background, and biobehavioral factors. The debate in medicine over a specialty in women's health is not unique. The history of academia abounds with descriptions of struggles to establish new fields and disciplines. Recent specialties, such as pediatrics and gerontology, which are distinguished by age rather than specific organ or system, struggled for establishment and recognition. Historically, nursing curricula has emulated the biomedical model that is reductionistic and contradictory to nursing's holistic mission. Rather than classifying women's health into a separate entity, women's health may be introduced into present curricula by employing feminist ideals and pedagogy throughout the curriculum. This approach would provide a mechanism to explore women's health issues that were previously minimally addressed at best, or not addressed at all. More important, students would be provided with an opportunity to examine the societal effects of racism, sexism, and classism, and this education would potentially lead to a growing awareness of concerns specific to women and minorities.",0.08391326483352340,0,0.4160867351664770,0
37393458,Cognitive phenomena measurement with time window-based multispectral brain mapping.,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive neuroscience experiments require accurate and traceable methods of measuring cognitive phenomena, analyzing and processing data, and validating results, including measurement of impact of such phenomena on brain activity and consciousness. EEG measurement is the most widely used tool for evaluation of the experiment's progress. To extract more information from the EEG signal, continuous innovation is necessary to provide a broader range of information. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a new tool for measuring and mapping cognitive phenomena using time window-based multispectral brain mapping of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. METHODS: The tool was developed using Python programming language and enables users to create brain maps images for six spectra (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Mu) of EEG signal. The system can accept an arbitrary number of EEG channels with standardized labels based on the 10-20 system, and users can select the channels, frequency bandwidth, type of signal processing, and time window length to perform the mapping. RESULTS: The key advantage of this tool is its ability to perform short-time brain mapping, which allows for the exploration and measurement of cognitive phenomena. The tool's performance was evaluated through testing on real EEG signals, and results demonstrated its effectiveness in accurately mapping cognitive phenomena. CONCLUSION: The developed tool can be used in various applications, including cognitive neuroscience research and clinical studies. Future work involves optimizing the tool's performance and expanding its capabilities.",0.323950363536708,0,0.17604963646329200,0
775639,Evaluation of transcendental meditation as a method of reducing stress.,"Transcendental meditation is said to induce in its practitioners an altered state of consciousness resulting in relief of stress, an increased sense of awareness, and a sense of well-being. Release of catecholamines has been associated widely with stress and lends itself to quantitation. Plasma epinephrine and norephinephrine, as well as lactate, were measured in 12 volunteers before, during, and after meditation. Values were compared with those obtained from controls matched for sex and age who rested instead of meditating. Essentially the same results were obtained for the two groups, which suggests that meditation does not induce a unique metabolic state but is seen biochemically as a resting state.",0.12798950376084300,0,0.3720104962391570,0

We suggest that not only the 'consciousness' in neural correlates of consciousness is a confused term, but 'correlates' is as well. When brain events are found to covary with conscious experience, these brain events can be the neural substrates of the experience, as is often (implicitly) suggested, but they can also be neural prerequisites or neural consequences of the experience. We here disentangle these different sorts of brain processes conceptually. But we also propose a concrete multi-pronged research program that may, in near-future consciousness research, distinguish these brain processes empirically.",0.8816614832484010,1,0.38166148324840100,1

Spatial attention augmented the orientation-selective adaptation to invisible adaptor orientation. The effect of attention was clearest for test stimuli at peri-threshold, intermediate contrast levels, suggesting that previous negative results were due to assessing orientation discrimination at maximum contrast. On the basis of these findings we propose a constrained hypothesis for the difference between neuronal mechanisms of spatial attention in the presence versus absence of awareness.",0.15479565598977500,0,0.3452043440102250,0
37804009,The utility of the perfusion index as an indicator of anesthetic depth for repeated propofol sedation in children: An observational study.,"BACKGROUND: Children receiving proton therapy require repeated sedation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the utility of the perfusion index (PI) for evaluating consciousness level during repeated propofol sedation. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, children aged from birth to 19 years old scheduled for proton therapy under repeated propofol sedation were enrolled. The primary outcome was the equivalence of PI values 5 min after anesthesia induction on consecutive sedation. Total consumption of propofol during sedation, time to reach the University of Michigan sedation scale (UMSS) score 1 after end of proton therapy, and duration of post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) stay were recorded. RESULTS: The PI values measured 5 min after induction of anesthesia were not equivalent to each other in consecutive sedation except for the second versus third (1st vs. 2nd: 97.5% CI: -1.34, 0.91; p = 0.206, 0.034; 2nd vs. 3rd: 97.5% CI: -0.87, 0.94; p = 0.023, 0.036 3rd vs. 4th: 97.5% CI: -2.08, -0.26; p < 0.99, <0.001; 4th vs. 5th: 97.5% CI: 0.21, 2.28; p < 0.001, >0.99; respectively). In consecutive sedation, there was not a significantly different difference in the time to reach UMSS score 1 (p > 0.99, all) for total consumption of propofol, time to reach UMSS score 1 after the end of proton therapy, and duration of PACU stay. CONCLUSIONS: During repeated propofol sedation in children, PI was insufficient to be used as an indicator of consciousness level assessment. However, we suggest that the information related to repeated sedation provided by this study may be helpful in clinical practice.",0.11352899233294000,0,0.38647100766706000,0

39499610,Gait Symmetric Adaptation and Aftereffect Through Concurrent Split-Belt Treadmill Walking and Explicit Visual Feedback Distortion.,"OBJECTIVE: Gait asymmetry can be improved with various gait training methods. Combining split-belt treadmill walking (SB) with visual feedback distortion (VD) could enhance motor learning, improving gait symmetry adaptation and retention. This study compared step length symmetry adaptation and aftereffects between SB-only and combined explicit VD with SB, as well as between explicit VD-only and combined explicit VD with SB. METHOD: The 28-minute trials included three phases: a 3-minute baseline, a 10-minute adaptation, and a 15-minute post-adaptation. In the VD trial, two bars representing step lengths were displayed, with the right bar gradually decreasing by 3% to prompt participants to consciously correct their steps to match the heights of the two bars. In the SB trial, the right treadmill belt speed was incrementally increased by 5%. The VD+SB trial combined both perturbations. After the removal of these perturbations, the aftereffect of the adapted asymmetric step length was evaluated in the post-adaptation period. RESULTS: During the adaptation period, the step length symmetry ratio shifted negatively in the SB trial, while it increased positively in the VD trial, indicating longer right steps than left. In the VD+SB trial, subjects extended their right step more than their left. Notably, the VD+SB trial demonstrated a longer aftereffect compared to both the SB-only and VD-only trials. CONCLUSION: The visual distortion paradigm can be explicitly applied and integrated with split-belt treadmill walking to enhance the efficacy of symmetric gait adaptation, resulting in more sustained effects on the retention of newly learned motor patterns.",0.19669886500569700,0,0.3033011349943030,0
31437691,Motor response influences perceptual awareness judgements.,"What is the relation between perceptual awareness and action? In this study we tested the hypothesis that motor response influences perceptual awareness judgements. We used a perceptual discrimination task in which presentation of the stimulus was immediately followed by a cue requiring a motor response that was irrelevant to the task but could be the same, opposite, or neutral to the correct response to the stimulus. After responding to the cue, participants rated their stimulus awareness using the Perceptual Awareness Scale, and then carried out their discrimination response. Participants reported a higher level of stimulus awareness after carrying out responses that were either congruent or incongruent with the response required by the stimulus, compared to the neutral condition. The results suggest that the motor response overlapping with a potential response to the stimulus provides information about the outcome of decision process and increases the reported awareness of stimuli.",0.8329932250856560,1,0.33299322508565600,1

35737717,Modeling cortical synaptic effects of anesthesia and their cholinergic reversal.,"General anesthetics work through a variety of molecular mechanisms while resulting in the common end point of sedation and loss of consciousness. Generally, the administration of common anesthetics induces reduction in synaptic excitation while promoting synaptic inhibition. Exogenous modulation of the anesthetics' synaptic effects can help determine the neuronal pathways involved in anesthesia. For example, both animal and human studies have shown that exogenously induced increases in acetylcholine in the brain can elicit wakeful-like behavior despite the continued presence of the anesthetic. However, the underlying mechanisms of anesthesia reversal at the cellular level have not been investigated. Here we apply a computational model of a network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons to simulate the network-wide effects of anesthesia, due to changes in synaptic inhibition and excitation, and their reversal by cholinergic activation through muscarinic receptors. We use a differential evolution algorithm to fit model parameters to match measures of spiking activity, neuronal connectivity, and network dynamics recorded in the visual cortex of rodents during anesthesia with desflurane in vivo. We find that facilitating muscarinic receptor effects of acetylcholine on top of anesthetic-induced synaptic changes predicts the reversal of anesthetic suppression of neurons' spiking activity, functional connectivity, as well as pairwise and population interactions. Thus, our model predicts a specific neuronal mechanism for the cholinergic reversal of anesthesia consistent with experimental behavioral observations.",0.3429626302260770,0,0.1570373697739230,0
8916829,"Nitric oxide synthase inhibitors, 7-nitro indazole and nitroG-L-arginine methyl ester, dose dependently reduce the threshold for isoflurane anesthesia.","BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO), a recognized cell messenger for activating soluble guanylate cyclase, is produced by the enzyme NO synthase in a wide variety of tissues, including vascular endothelium and the central nervous system. The authors previously reported the possible involvement of the NO pathway in the anesthetic state by showing that a specific NO synthase inhibitor, nitroG-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), dose dependently and reversibly decreases the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for halothane anesthesia. The availability of a structurally distinct inhibitor selective for the neuronal isoform of NO synthase, 7-nitro indazole (7-NI), allowed for the possibility of dissociating the central nervous system effects of neuronal NO synthase inhibition from the cardiovascular effects of endothelial NO synthase inhibition. METHODS: The effect of two structurally distinct inhibitors of NO synthase, L-NAME and 7-NI, on the MAC of isoflurane was investigated in Sprague-Dawley rats while concurrently monitoring the animals' arterial blood pressure and heart rate. L-NAME (1 to 30 mg/kg given intravenously, dissolved in 0.9% saline) and 7-NI (20 to 1,000 mg/kg given intraperitoneally, dissolved in arachis oil) were administered after determining control MAC and 30 min before determining MAC in the presence of NO synthase inhibitor. RESULTS: L-NAME and 7-NI caused a dose-dependent decrease from isoflurane control MAC (maximal effect: 35.5 +/- 2.5% and 43.0 +/- 1.7%, respectively) with a ceiling effect observed for both NO synthase inhibitors (above 10 mg/kg and 120 mg/kg, respectively). L-NAME administration significantly increased systolic and diastolic blood pressures (maximal effect: 39.9 +/- 2.2% and 64.3 +/- 4.0%, respectively), which were not accompanied by any changes in heart rate. 7-NI administration resulted in no changes in blood pressure and a small but clinically insignificant decrease in heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of the NO synthase pathway decreased the MAC for isoflurane, which suggests that inhibition of the NO pathway decreases the level of consciousness and augments sedation, analgesia, and anesthesia. The MAC reduction by two structurally distinct NO synthase inhibitors supports that this is a specific effect on NO synthase. Furthermore, the action of the neuronal NO synthase inhibitor 7-NI supports an effect selective for neuronal NO synthase and also avoids the hypertensive response of generalized NO synthase inhibitors.",0.09931162876965380,0,0.4006883712303460,0

METHODS: Children who had at some time been treated with Stesolid rectiole for seizure relief were questioned about feelings of shame in relation to this treatment and their expectation of bullying by peers who might be aware of it. In addition to parental shame, parental worries concerning their children's epilepsy were explored. Data from 39 patients (18 girls) aged 5-19 years were analysed. RESULTS: Of the children aged over seven, most girls (9/12), but not boys (1/6) reported to feeling a sense of shame. Children's shame was not related to parental shame, parental worries or seizure severity. A higher frequency of rectiole applications was related to a stronger expectation of being bullied.

It is unclear whether a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is sufficient to precipitate CTE neuropathology. We examined the association between TBI and CTE neuropathology in 580 deceased individuals exposed to RHIs from football. TBI history was assessed using a modified version of the Ohio State University TBI Identification Method Short Form administered to informants. There were 22 donors who had no TBI, 213 who had at least one TBI without loss of consciousness (LOC), 345 who had TBI with LOC, and, of those with a history of TBI with LOC, 36 who had at least one moderate-to-severe TBI (msTBI, LOC >30 min). CTE neuropathology was diagnosed in 405. There was no association between CTE neuropathology status or severity and TBI with LOC (odds ratio [OR] = 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.64-1.41; OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 0.71-2.09) or msTBI (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.33-1.50; OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.30-3.41).

19496685,Development of the calcium plateau following status epilepticus: role of calcium in epileptogenesis.,"Status epilepticus is a clinical emergency defined as continuous seizure activity or rapid, recurrent seizures without regaining consciousness and can lead to the development of acquired epilepsy, characterized by spontaneous, recurrent seizures. Understanding epileptogenesis--the transformation of healthy brain tissue into hyperexcitable neuronal networks--is an important challenge and the elucidation of molecular mechanisms can lend insight into new therapeutic targets to halt this progression. It has been demonstrated that intracellular calcium increases during status epilepticus and that these elevations are maintained past the duration of the injury (Ca(2+) plateau). As an important second messenger, Ca(2+) elevations can lead to changes in gene expression, neurotransmitter release and plasticity. Thus, characterization of the post-injury Ca(2+) plateau may be important in eventually understanding the pathophysiology of epileptogenesis and preventing the progression to chronic epilepsy after brain injury.",0.17721125996539400,0,0.32278874003460600,0

Patient A is a 45-year old man who lost consciousness after drinking a clear unknown liquid. He was brought to the Emergency Departement (ED) after he was intubated. His partner notified the liquid could be GBL, a prodrug for GHB. He regained consciousness 16 hours later in the intensive care unit (ICU) where he could be successfully extubated. Patient B is a 25-year old man who was found unconscious at home with next to him an empty bottle of GBL. He was intubated in the intensive care unit. He could be extubated after 12 hours. GBL intoxication is becoming a more frequent problem and overdosage of GBL can rapidly occur because of its rapid onset and high potency when compared to GHB.

37761627,What Is It like to Be a Brain Organoid? Phenomenal Consciousness in a Biological Neural Network.,"It has been shown that three-dimensional self-assembled multicellular structures derived from human pluripotent stem cells show electrical activity similar to EEG. More recently, neurons were successfully embedded in digital game worlds. The biologically inspired neural network (BNN), expressing human cortical cells, was able to show internal modification and learn the task at hand (predicting the trajectory of a digital ball while moving a digital paddle). In other words, the system allowed to read motor information and write sensory data into cell cultures. In this article, we discuss Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC) theories, and their capacity to predict or even allow for consciousness in a BNN. We found that Information Integration Theory (IIT) is the only NCC that offers the possibility for a BNN to show consciousness, since the Phi value in the BNN is >0. In other words, the recording of real-time neural activity responding to environmental stimuli. IIT argues that any system capable of integrating information will have some degree of phenomenal consciousness. We argue that the pattern of activity appearing in the BNN, with increased density of sensory information leading to better performance, implies that the BNN could be conscious. This may have profound implications from a psychological, philosophical, and ethical perspective.",0.7006538247550230,1,0.20065382475502300,1
37520790,Not Just Mechanical Birthing Bodies: Birthing Consciousness and Birth Reflexes.,"There are two concepts of neuroendocrine reflexes associated with the expulsion of the fetus through the birth canal during the second stage of birth: the Ferguson reflex and the fetus ejection reflex. These concepts are often confused with one another and treated synonymously, thus interchangeable. However, the two not only refer to different phenomena, but they also represent the birthing woman differently. The Ferguson reflex treats the birthing woman as simply a biomechanical body. In contrast, the fetus ejection reflex does not ignore women's conscious states during birth and recognizes what is currently a well-known empirical fact: The event of birth is a complex biophysical process affected by many mental, social, and environmental factors. In that, it has a connection to the phenomenon of birthing consciousness, which is the positive altered state sometimes experienced during a physiological and undisturbed childbirth. We argue that birthing consciousness and the fetus ejection reflex, made possible by reduced cortical control, are extremely helpful in promoting physiological human childbirth. Therefore, treating a woman giving birth as a biomechanical body is not only erroneous but can also lead to medical mismanagement of the second stage of physiological childbirth with associated mental and physiological consequences.",0.5788033062665300,1,0.07880330626652950,0

The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of head trauma and/or epilepsy on delinquent behavior. We examined 1,336 juvenile delinquents (1,151 males and 185 females) who had been admitted to the Nagoya Juvenile Classification Home, Aichi, Japan. Among them, 52 subjects with a history of epilepsy, convulsion or loss of consciousness, head injury requiring neurological assessment and/or treatment, or neurosurgical operation (head trauma/epilepsy group), were examined by electroencephalography and compared to subjects without these histories (control group) with respect to types of crime, history of amphetamine use, psychiatric treatment, child abuse, and family history. Among the 52 subjects, 43 (82.7%) showed abnormal findings. The head trauma/epilepsy group had significantly higher rates of psychiatric treatment (P<0.0001, OR=16.852, 95% CI=8.068-35.199) and family history of drug abuse (P<0.05, OR=2.303, 95% CI=1.003-5.290). Furthermore, the percentage of members who were sent to juvenile training school by the family court was significantly higher in the head trauma/epilepsy group (72.5%) than in the control group (38.9%, P<0.0001).

17086769,CNS oxygen toxicity in closed-circuit diving: signs and symptoms before loss of consciousness.,"INTRODUCTION: There is a dearth of information regarding CNS oxygen toxicity accidents in closed-circuit oxygen diving. The aims of the present study were to report the sensations and symptoms that accompany CNS oxygen toxicity accidents, and to evaluate whether loss of consciousness can occur without any warning signs. METHODS: We documented 36 CNS oxygen toxicity accidents in closed-circuit oxygen diving. The full accident inquiry included the first report from the diving unit, an interview of the victim and his buddy by the researchers, and an examination of the diving equipment. RESULTS: The symptoms that appeared before termination of a dive, as reported by the victim or his buddy, were as follows (in descending order of frequency): limb convulsions; hyperventilation; difficulty maintaining a steady depth; headache; and visual disturbances. The symptoms that appeared after detachment from the mouthpiece were, in descending order of frequency: headache; loss of consciousness; confusion; weakness; dizziness; and facial muscle twitching and limb convulsions. A high inspired CO2 [mean 4.2 kPa (29.9 mmHg)] was connected with loss of consciousness. No dive was terminated before at least two symptoms (mean 3.4) had been noted a minimum of 5 min before termination. DISCUSSION: Symptoms that are accepted as being related to CNS oxygen toxicity, as well as others such as headache, difficulty maintaining a steady depth, hyperventilation, weakness, and a choking sensation, were more frequent among the O2 accident victims compared with divers who did not interrupt their dives. CONCLUSION: Awareness of any unusual sensation can prevent a potentially dangerous situation from arising.",0.2171537462178060,0,0.2828462537821940,0

18196288,Patient-oncologist communication in advanced cancer: predictors of patient perception of prognosis.,"GOALS OF WORK: Advanced cancer patients' perceptions of prognosis, which are often overly optimistic compared to oncologist estimates, influence treatment preferences. The predictors of patients' perceptions and the effect of oncologist communication on patient understanding are unclear. This study was designed to identify the communication factors that influence patient-oncologist concordance about chance of cure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed audiorecorded encounters between 51 oncologists and 141 advanced cancer patients with good (n = 69) or poor (n = 72) concordance about chance of cure. Encounters were coded for communication factors that might influence oncologist-patient concordance, including oncologist statements of optimism and pessimism. MAIN RESULTS: Oncologists made more statements of optimism (mean = 3.3 per encounter) than statements of pessimism (mean = 1.2 per encounter). When oncologists made at least one statement of pessimism, patients were more likely to agree with their oncologist's estimated chance of cure (OR = 2.59, 95%CI = 1.31-5.12). Statements of optimism and uncertainty were not associated with an increased likelihood that patients would agree or disagree with their oncologists about chance of cure. CONCLUSIONS: Communication of pessimistic information to patients with advanced cancer increases the likelihood that patients will report concordant prognostic estimates. Communication of optimistic information does not have any direct effect. The best communication strategy to maximize patient knowledge for informed decision making while remaining sensitive to patients' emotional needs may be to emphasize optimistic aspects of prognosis while also consciously and clearly communicating pessimistic aspects of prognosis.",0.04517638031979840,0,0.4548236196802020,0
33566872,Neuron-specific enolase level as a predictor of neurological outcome in near-hanging patients: A retrospective multicenter study.,"OBJECTIVES: Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is frequently used to predict neurological outcomes in patients with hypoxic brain injury. Hanging can cause hypoxic brain damage, and survivors can suffer from neurological deficits that may impair daily activities. Here, we investigated the utility of the initial serum NSE level as a predictor of neurological outcomes in near-hanging patients with decreased consciousness. METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study was conducted in patients who visited the emergency department due to near-hanging injury from October 2013 to February 2019 at three university hospitals in Korea. They were divided into two groups according to the presence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The neurological outcome was determined using the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) measured at the time of discharge. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine whether initial serum NSE is an independent predictor of neurological outcome. RESULTS: Of the 70 patients included in the study, 44 showed a poor neurological outcome (CPC score = 3-5). Among the 52 patients with cardiac arrest, only 10 (19.2%) were discharged with good neurological outcome (CPC score = 1-2). In the whole cohort, a high serum NSE level was a significant predictor of poor neurological outcome (odds ratio [OR], 1.343; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.003-1.800, p = 0.048). Among the patients with cardiac arrest, a high serum NSE level was a significant predictor of poor neurological outcome (OR, 1.138; 95% CI, 1.009-1.284, p = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: In near-hanging patients, a high initial serum NSE level is an independent predictor of poor neurological outcome.",0.04893600673395770,0,0.4510639932660420,0

29491031,State-dependent judgement bias in Drosophila: evidence for evolutionarily primitive affective processes.,"Affective states influence decision-making under ambiguity in humans and other animals. Individuals in a negative state tend to interpret ambiguous cues more negatively than individuals in a positive state. We demonstrate that the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, also exhibits state-dependent changes in cue interpretation. Drosophila were trained on a Go/Go task to approach a positive (P) odour associated with a sugar reward and actively avoid a negative (N) odour associated with shock. Trained flies were then either shaken to induce a purported negative state or left undisturbed (control), and given a choice between: air or P; air or N; air or ambiguous odour (1 : 1 blend of P : N). Shaken flies were significantly less likely to approach the ambiguous odour than control flies. This 'judgement bias' may be mediated by changes in neural activity that reflect evolutionarily primitive affective states. We cannot say whether such states are consciously experienced, but use of this model organism's versatile experimental tool kit may facilitate elucidation of their neural and genetic basis.",0.2618592470154850,0,0.2381407529845150,0

37756616,Conscious expectancy rather than associative strength elicits brain activity during single-cue fear conditioning.,"The neurocognitive processes underlying Pavlovian conditioning in humans are still largely debated. The conventional view is that conditioned responses (CRs) emerge automatically as a function of the contingencies between a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US). As such, the associative strength model asserts that the frequency or amplitude of CRs reflects the strength of the CS-US associations. Alternatively, the expectation model asserts that the presentation of the CS triggers conscious expectancy of the US, which is responsible for the production of CRs. The present study tested the hypothesis that there are dissociable brain networks related to the expectancy and associative strength theories using a single-cue fear conditioning paradigm with a pseudo-random intermittent reinforcement schedule during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants' (n = 21) trial-by-trial expectations of receiving shock displayed a significant linear effect consistent with the expectation model. We also found a positive linear relationship between the expectancy model and activity in frontoparietal brain areas including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsomedial PFC. While an exploratory analysis found a linear relationship consistent with the associated strength model in the insula and early visual cortex, our primary results are consistent with the view that conscious expectancy contributes to CRs.",0.5137069686283750,1,0.013706968628375200,1

Isolated pelvic presentation is restricted to case reports in adults. We describe a unique presentation of HL as a primary pelvic disease in an 11-year-old prepubertal girl. She was treated based on the Euronet-Paediatric Hodgkin's Lymphoma Group protocol (EuroNet-PHL-C1) recommendations and assigned to treatment Group 2 (Stage IIB). The patient had bulky disease and a suboptimal response on interim 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. The child was administered chemotherapy alone. Pelvic radiotherapy was consciously avoided due to the high risk of gonadal failure. She remains disease-free for 18 months now.

METHODS: Thirty-one patients with disorders of consciousness were recruited from 6 Norwegian hospitals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CRS-R and the Disability Rating Scale. RESULTS: Reliability measures were good for the CRS-R total scores and moderate to good for its subscales. Diagnostic agreement among examiners was good. Raters' experience with the CRS-R favorably influenced reliability. Sensitivity and specificity analyses demonstrated better detection of patients in minimally conscious state on the CRS-R relative to the Disability Rating Scale. CONCLUSIONS: The CRS-R is a reliable tool for diagnosing vegetative state and minimally conscious state.

40467694,AraTraditions10k bridging cultures with a comprehensive dataset for enhanced cross lingual image annotation retrieval and tagging.,"The exponential growth of multimedia content in the digital age has necessitated the development of advanced cross-lingual systems capable of understanding and interpreting visual information across different languages. However, current efforts have predominantly been focused on monolingual tasks, leaving a substantial gap in cross-lingual multimedia analysis, particularly for non-English languages. To address this gap, AraTraditions10k, a comprehensive and culturally rich dataset, has been introduced to enhance cross-lingual image annotation, retrieval, and tagging, with a specific focus on Arabic and English languages. The dataset consists of 10,000 carefully curated images representing diverse aspects of Arabic culture, each annotated with five captions in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and professionally translated into English. To maximize the utility of the dataset, advanced machine learning models, including a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for tag recommendation and an enhanced Word2VisualVec (W2VV) model for sentence recommendation, have been developed. These models have been augmented with attention mechanisms and contrastive loss functions, resulting in measurable performance improvements. Notably, the tag recommendation system achieved an overall top-1 accuracy of 93%, while the sentence recommendation system for the English language attained BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and SPICE scores of 78.2, 68.3, 75.8, 136.7, and 52.0, respectively. By addressing the linguistic and cultural gaps in existing datasets, AraTraditions10k establishes a new benchmark for the quality and inclusivity of multilingual datasets, contributing to the broader field of cross-lingual multimedia analysis and facilitating the development of more accessible and culturally sensitive multimedia technologies.",0.53097791201905,1,0.03097791201905000,0

This study investigates the neurocognitive basis of conscious and unconscious influences of object-location memory in amnesic patients with Korsakoff's syndrome (N = 23) and healthy controls (N = 18) using a process-dissociation procedure in a computerized spatial memory task. As expected, the patients performed substantially worse on the conscious memory measures but showed even slightly stronger effects of unconscious influences than the controls. Moreover, a delayed test administered after 1 week revealed a strong decline in conscious influences in the patients, while unconscious influences were not affected. The presented results suggest that conscious and unconscious influences of spatial memory can be clearly dissociated in Korsakoff's syndrome.",0.04852295663904920,0,0.4514770433609510,0

This condition is termed normal ventricular hydrocephalus and represents the most severe form of slit ventricle syndrome. CASE REPORT: A 7-year-old girl with a repaired lumbosacral myelomeningocele and shunted at birth who presented with headache, vomiting, seizure, and deterioration of level of consciousness was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. Because her ventricles were small to slitlike on cranial computed tomographic (CT) scan, the shunt was presumed to be working. Although the cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal, she received initial empirical treatment of viral encephalitis. Twenty-four hours after admission, she evolved with apnea and bradycardia, requiring ventilatory support. Repeated CT scans were unchanged from one study to the next. After 48 hours, her condition worsened, and cerebrospinal pressure during lumbar puncture reached more than 30 mm Hg despite the serial CT scan disclosing no ventricular enlargement. She underwent a shunt revision that showed that the catheter was occluded and had adhered to the ventricular wall. The shunt was replaced, resulting in dramatic neurological improvement. This report highlights a life-threatening condition involving chronically shunted children who present severe intracranial hypertension without ventriculomegaly and may often be neglected or unrecognized by emergency physicians or general neurosurgeons.",0.15356848355946600,0,0.3464315164405340,0

Cerebral angiography showed vascular irregularities such as segmental narrowing and sausage-like dilation on proximal portion of the ipsilateral anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries. Same findings were seen on peripheral portions of the posterior cerebral artery on the same side. Moreover sequential angiograms showed appearance of an aneurysm in the left middle cerebral artery (M2 potion). Under the diagnosis of cerebral angiitis associated with HZO, she was treated with antiviral agents, antiplatelet drugs, steroid and stellate ganglion block.

METHODS: This study on cost consciousness was part of the German Safety4NICU study, a cross-sectional survey conducted from 2015 to 2016. All 224 German NICUs were invited to take part in the survey, and written consent was obtained from the leading physicians and nurses. The various professions were addressed via specific questionnaires. The cost survey tool identified the participants' responsibility and their desired focus on cost consciousness. RESULTS: Of the 1406 nurses and 496 physicians from 84 NICUs, 64.4% of the nurses and 62.5% of the physicians agreed that they shared responsibility for controlling costs. The computed score to define the overall cost consciousness level was 4.47. We identified a significantly positive association between cost consciousness, longer total clinical work experience and a decreased number of NICU intensive care beds. Increased cost consciousness was found in both men and physicians. Other hospital characteristics did not have an effect. CONCLUSION: Neonatology is a medical speciality where the tension between economics and the benefit of patients is extremely high.

34243940,Effect of electroencephalogram-guided anaesthesia administration on 1-yr mortality: follow-up of a randomised clinical trial.,"BACKGROUND: Intraoperative EEG suppression duration has been associated with postoperative delirium and mortality. In a clinical trial testing anaesthesia titration to avoid EEG suppression, the intervention did not decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium, but was associated with reduced 30-day mortality. The present study evaluated whether the EEG-guided anaesthesia intervention was also associated with reduced 1-yr mortality. METHODS: This manuscript reports 1 yr follow-up of subjects from a single-centre RCT, including a post hoc secondary outcome (1-yr mortality) in addition to pre-specified secondary outcomes. The trial included subjects aged 60 yr or older undergoing surgery with general anaesthesia between January 2015 and May 2018. Patients were randomised to receive EEG-guided anaesthesia or usual care. The previously reported primary outcome was postoperative delirium. The outcome of the current study was all-cause 1-yr mortality. RESULTS: Of the 1232 subjects enrolled, 614 subjects were randomised to EEG-guided anaesthesia and 618 subjects to usual care. One-year mortality was 57/591 (9.6%) in the guided group and 62/601 (10.3%) in the usual-care group. No significant difference in mortality was observed (adjusted absolute risk difference, -0.7%; 99.5% confidence interval, -5.8% to 4.3%; P=0.68). CONCLUSIONS: An EEG-guided anaesthesia intervention aiming to decrease duration of EEG suppression during surgery did not significantly decrease 1-yr mortality. These findings, in the context of other studies, do not provide supportive evidence for EEG-guided anaesthesia to prevent intermediate term postoperative death.

We investigated whether corresponding facial reactions can be elicited when people are unconsciously exposed to happy and angry facial expressions. Through use of the backward-masking technique, the subjects were prevented from consciously perceiving 30-ms exposures of happy, neutral, and angry target faces, which immediately were followed and masked by neutral faces. Despite the fact that exposure to happy and angry faces was unconscious, the subjects reacted with distinct facial muscle reactions that corresponded to the happy and angry stimulus faces.

Our objective is to analyze whether clinical presentation follows a uniform pattern or whether there is evidence for different subtypes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-one pediatric hospitals and one diabetes center in Baden-Wuerttemberg (BW), Germany, participated in this study. The hospital records of 2121 children below 15 yr of age were examined retrospectively. Statistical analysis was done after logarithmic transformation into a normal distribution. RESULTS: The average duration of symptoms was found to be 15.2 d (95% CI (Confidence Intervals) = 14.3-16.1) ranging between 2.0 and 180 d (95% central range). The most frequent symptoms were polyuria and polydipsia; 7.2% presented with altered level of consciousness. The mean blood glucose value was 407.9 mg/dL (95% CI = 400.0-416.0), corresponding to 23.3 mmol/L (95% CI = 22.8-23.8). The median pH value was 7.35 (95% CI = 7.34-7.36), and the median base excess was -5 mmol/L (95% CI =-5 to -4). The younger patients had a shorter duration of symptoms and suffered most frequently from ketoacidosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although the symptoms of diabetes at its onset follow a uniform pattern, the clinical presentation and duration of symptoms indicate that there may be various forms of type 1 diabetes.",0.39575239569217300,0,0.10424760430782700,0
33916306,Familial Correlates of Leisure Time Activities among Polish Early School-Age Children: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"The after-school period may play a critical role in the accumulation of children's physical activity and sedentary time. The study aimed to characterize familial correlates of early school-age children's leisure time activities. A cross-sectional study was conducted among a group of 223 children (mean age 8.7 +/- 0.5) and their parents. The percentage of children with daily leisure time physical activity (LTPA) >1 h was 23.32%, and with daily screen time <2 h was 32.74%. The average children's leisure time physical activity was significantly higher on weekend days than on weekdays (114.85 vs. 89.43 min, p = 0.005). Similarly, the average screen time was higher on weekend days than on weekdays (95.50 vs. 66.10 min, p < 0.001). The multivariate regression analysis revealed that independent predictors of children's leisure time physical activity were the father's education level and the father's occupational status, whereas at least one parent with higher education correlated negatively with children's longer screen time. The study showed that children's leisure time activities are associated with parental education and differ significantly between weekdays and weekend days. These findings underline the need for screening for unfavorable health behaviors among early school-age children, and indicate that health promotion programs should be oriented on both parents and children aiming to improve parental health consciousness, reduce screen time and increase physical activity, especially during the weekend.",0.20357540905736500,0,0.2964245909426350,0
24665814,"Placebo versus ""standard"" hypnosis rationale: attitudes, expectancies, hypnotic responses, and experiences.","In this study participants were provided with either the standard rationale that accompanies the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility: A (Shor & Orne, 1962) or a rationale that presented hypnosis as a nondeceptive placebo, consistent with Kirsch's (1994) sociocognitive perspective of hypnosis. The effects of the placebo and standard rationales were highly comparable with respect to hypnotic attitudes; prehypnotic expectancies; objective, subjective, and involuntariness measures of hypnotic responding; as well as a variety of subjective experiences during hypnosis, as measured by the Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory (Pekala, 1982). Differences among correlations were not evident when measures were compared across groups. However, indices of hypnotic responding were correlated with attitudes in the hypnosis but not the placebo condition, and, generally speaking, the link between subjective experiences during hypnosis and measures of hypnotic responding were more reliable in the placebo than the hypnosis group. Researcher findings are neutral with respect to providing support for altered state versus sociocognitive models of hypnosis.",0.24989370017081400,0,0.2501062998291860,0
35855167,Apoplexy in sellar metastasis from papillary thyroid cancer: A case report and literature review.,"BACKGROUND: Pituitary metastasis from papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is rare and only a few cases have been reported. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a patient who presented with visual dysfunction and panhypopituitarism. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a pituitary tumor and hydrocephalus. Transsphenoidal surgery had been indicated, but his surgery had been postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic. During that waiting period, he showed pituitary apoplexy with consciousness disturbance, resulting in acute adrenal insufficiency and diabetes insipidus. He was urgently hospitalized and underwent transsphenoidal surgery. Rapid and permanent pathological examinations have confirmed metastasis of PTC to the pituitary. The patient also underwent serial thyroidectomy. He was also suspected to have secondary hydrocephalus and underwent lumboperitoneal shunting after excluding cerebrospinal fluid metastasis. Thereafter, his cognitive dysfunction and performance status improved dramatically. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first patient with PTC who developed pituitary apoplexy secondary to metastasis.",0.3641071046522240,0,0.1358928953477760,0

Treatment and management of severe pulmonary tuberculosis: Yuta HAYASHI, Kenji OGAWA (Department of Respiratory Medicine, National Hospital Organization Higashi Nagoya National Hospital). Death of a young (non-elderly) patient may become a large psychological burden not only for patient's family but also for medical staff. We analyzed non-elderly cases with severe pulmonary tuberculosis by comparing 13 patients who died of tuberculosis in the hospital (death group) and 31 patients who survived and were discharged from hospital (survivor group). The mean age was older and there were more patients who were out of employment in the death group compared to the survivor group. Among the factors related to the general condition evaluated on the admission, disturbance of consciousness, respiratory insufficiency, impairment in the ADL, poor dietary intake, and decubitus ulcer were more observed in the death group. Chest X-ray finding was not a predictive factor of poor prognosis. Among the laboratory findings, the numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes, red blood cells, and thrombocytes significantly decreased in the death group. Serum level of total cholesterol, cholinesterase, and albumin were also significantly lower in the death group, indicating that malnutrition was related to the death of severe tuberculosis. Further studies are needed to establish the optimal nutritional management and evaluate the effectiveness of adjunctive use of steroid for severe tuberculosis patients. Invasive fungal infection complicated with pulmonary tuberculosis: Akira WATANABE, Katsuhiko KAMEI (Division of Clinical Research, Medical Mycology Research Center, Chiba University). Among the invasive mycoses, chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) is the most frequent disease as a sequel to pulmonary tuberculosis. However, identifying CPA early in patient with persistent pulmonary shadows from pulmonary tuberculosis is difficult. Serum microbiological tests such as Aspergillus precipitans (principally for Aspergillus IgG antibodies) are useful but sensitivity and specificity of this test are not high. Even treated, CPA has a case mortality rate of 50% over a span of 5 years. Morbidity is marked by both systemic and respiratory symptom and hemoptysis. Loss of lung function and life-threatening hemoptysis are common. As invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, early diagnosis and treatment of CPA might improve the outcome. Regarding the treatment, concomitant use of some anti-tubercular agents and antifungals is contradicted. Treatment and management for pulmonary tuberculosis complicated with COPD and interstitial pneumonia: Shinji TAMAKI, Takashi KUGE, Midori TAMURA, Sayuri TANAKA, Eiko YOSHINO, Mouka TAMURA (National Hospital Organization Nara Medical Center), Hiroshi KIMURA (Second Department of Internal Medicine and Respiratory Medicine, Nara Medical University) Recently, patients of pulmonary tuberculosis have many complications especially in the elderly population. It is recognized that patients with COPD and interstitial pneumonia (IP) have an increased risk for developing active tuberculosis. The aim of this report is to describe the clinical findings of pulmonary tuberculosis complicated with COPD and IP. We reviewed 327 patients who were diagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis. Twenty-six cases were complicated with COPD. All patients were male, and had smoking history. Cavitary lesions were observed only in 5 cases. Acute exacerbation of COPD occurred in one fatal case. Ten cases were complicated with IP. Cavitary lesions were observed in 3 cases. Acute exacerbation of IP were observed in 7 cases, and 4 patients died during the anti-tuberculosis treatment. Careful evaluation and treatment are necessary for tuberculosis patients complicated with COPD and IP.",0.09426690398892420,0,0.4057330960110760,0
28831928,[Driving status of syncope patients is not part of standard advice].,"OBJECTIVE: Some medical problems, such as syncope, have direct consequences for fitness to drive. Our objective was to discover if patients had been informed about their driving status after a syncopal episode by their physician, and if this advice was in line with current legislation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHOD: By means of a structured questionnaire, 150 patients referred to the syncope clinic at the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, were asked about the advice they had received concerning their driving status during previous consultations with their general practitioner or specialists. A syncope expert then assessed the driving status of all patients in the light of the existing and new ruling. RESULTS: In 121 of the 150 patients (81%), a certain or highly-likely cause for their loss of consciousness was determined: 68 patients had reflex syncope, 25 patients orthostatic hypotension, 20 patients psychogenic pseudosyncope, three patients cardiac syncope, three patients had epilepsy and two patients another diagnosis. Seven patients had experienced an episode while driving. Only 26/150 patients (17%) reported that the consequences of their episodes for their driving status had been discussed with them at earlier consultations. If driving was discussed, in only 31% had the current Dutch legislation on driving been followed. Over a third (38%) of the patients felt they should no longer drive. CONCLUSION: Fewer than one in five patients reported that driving status was discussed by a physician after a syncope episode.

36232192,"Awareness Campaigns in a Horizontally Differentiated Market with Environmentally Conscious Consumers, Private Versus Public Duopoly.","This paper examines horizontally differentiated duopolies a la Hotelling with environmentally conscious consumers and a planner promoting a sustainable good with costly awareness campaigns (ACs). The objective is to find the planner's optimal strategies and their effects on the firms' behaviour. The analysis is carried out with two approaches, considering a private and a public duopoly. In both, it is shown that the planner chooses the average characteristic supported by a higher intensity campaign. However, with the private one, such an outcome is possible if the planner has minimal resources. Consumer consciousness and ACs have opposite effects on the firms and the planner. It is proven that consumer awareness favours the interests of the duopolies and reduces those of the planner, while the contrary is true for ACs. Finally, it is shown that a public duopoly is the best scenario for sustainability. This study provides an environmental policy to replace or complement traditional instruments and a more suitable business framework to achieve efficient results.",0.47269621082808700,0,0.027303789171912600,0
37172575,Multiparametric non-linear TENS modulation to integrate intuitive sensory feedback.,"Objective. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has been recently introduced in neurorehabilitation and neuroprosthetics as a promising, non-invasive sensory feedback restoration alternative to implantable neurostimulation. Yet, the adopted stimulation paradigms are typically based on single-parameter modulations (e.g. pulse amplitude (PA), pulse-width (PW) or pulse frequency (PF)). They elicit artificial sensations characterized by a low intensity resolution (e.g. few perceived levels), low naturalness and intuitiveness, hindering the acceptance of this technology. To address these issues, we designed novel multiparametric stimulation paradigms, featuring the simultaneous modulation of multiple parameters, and implemented them in real-time tests of performance when exploited as artificial sensory inputs.Approach. We initially investigated the contribution of PW and PF variations to the perceived sensation magnitude through discrimination tests. Then, we designed three multiparametric stimulation paradigms comparing them with a standard PW linear modulation in terms of evoked sensation naturalness and intensity. The most performant paradigms were then implemented in real-time in a Virtual Reality-TENS platform to assess their ability to provide intuitive somatosensory feedback in a functional task.Main results. Our study highlighted a strong negative correlation between perceived naturalness and intensity: less intense sensations are usually deemed as more similar to natural touch. In addition, we observed that PF and PW changes have a different weight on the perceived sensation intensity. As a result, we adapted the activation charge rate (ACR) equation, proposed for implantable neurostimulation to predict the perceived intensity while co-modulating the PF and charge per pulse, to TENS (ACR(T)). ACR(T)allowed to design different multiparametric TENS paradigms with the same absolute perceived intensity. Although not reported as more natural, the multiparametric paradigm, based on sinusoidal PF modulation, resulted being more intuitive and subconsciously integrated than the standard linear one. This allowed subjects to achieve a faster and more accurate functional performance.Significance. Our findings suggest that TENS-based, multiparametric neurostimulation, despite not consciously perceived naturally, can provide integrated and more intuitive somatosensory information, as functionally proved. This could be exploited to design novel encoding strategies able to improve the performance of non-invasive sensory feedback technologies.",0.3735172005143780,0,0.12648279948562200,0
25883850,Decompressive craniectomy and early cranioplasty in a 15-year-old boy with N. meningitidis meningitis.,"BACKGROUND: Intracranial hypertension is a well-known life-threatening complication of bacterial meningitis. Investigations on decompressive craniectomy after failure of conservative management are scarce, but this surgical treatment should be considered and performed expeditiously, as it lowers the intracranial pressure and improves brain tissue oxygenation. Early cranioplasty can further aid the rehabilitation. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 15-year-old boy was admitted to our emergency department because of sudden onset of neurologic decline and consecutive loss of consciousness. Clinical examination and imaging showed elevated intracranial pressure, leading to the suspected diagnosis of meningitis. Intracranial pressure monitoring was installed, but the initiated conservative management failed. Finally, the patient underwent bilateral decompressive craniectomy. The microbiological test showed growth of Neisseria meningitidis. After full neurologic recovery, cranioplasty with two CAD/CAM titanium implants was conducted successfully. CONCLUSIONS: This unique report shows that decompressive craniotomy with duroplasty may be a crucial therapeutic approach in bacterial meningitis with refractory increased intracranial pressure and brainstem compression. Early cranioplasty with a patient-specific implant allowed the early and full reintegration of the patient.",0.36086697914156600,0,0.13913302085843400,0
28413549,Challenges in a case of ophthalmic artery aneurysm associated with abnormal internal carotid arteries.,"Ophthalmic artery aneurysms account for 5% of all cerebral aneurysms and are an important cause of morbidity and mortality related to subarachnoid hemorrhage. The diagnosis is often made only when the aneurysm is large enough to become symptomatic. They remain technically challenging for both neurosurgeon and interventional radiologist. We present the case of a 62-year-old woman admitted for transient loss of consciousness, followed by generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Computed tomography (CT) showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), clinically graded as Hunt and Hess III. Magnetic resonance imaging (angioMR) and the four-vessel digital subtraction angiography (DSA) identified a ruptured, 8 mm left ophthalmic artery aneurysm. Embolization was the first therapeutic choice. Nevertheless, the attempt had to be aborted due to a combination of a hypoplastic right internal carotid artery (ICA) and an irregular atheromatous plaque on the left ICA, rendering the procedure unduly hazardous. Therefore, microsurgical clipping of the aneurysm became the procedure of choice. Postoperatively, the patient was in good condition, with no visual and neurological deficits. At 6 months follow up, she was assigned maximum scores of 5 and 8 on the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and Extended GOS (GOS-E), respectively. Aneurysm rupture represents a neurosurgical emergency and an early intervention (less than 48 h) is recommended to maximize the chances of deficit-free survival. The peculiarities of this case consisted in the combination between the size and the location of the aneurysm, abrupt presentation, and the impossibility of embolization due to bilateral ICA abnormalities, congenital (hypoplastic right ICA) and acquired (extensively atherosclerotic left ICA).",0.4430965390115410,0,0.05690346098845890,0
26253525,Anger in brain and body: the neural and physiological perturbation of decision-making by emotion.,"Emotion and cognition are dynamically coupled to bodily arousal: the induction of anger, even unconsciously, can reprioritise neural and physiological resources toward action states that bias cognitive processes. Here we examine behavioural, neural and bodily effects of covert anger processing and its influence on cognition, indexed by lexical decision-making. While recording beat-to-beat blood pressure, the words ANGER or RELAX were presented subliminally just prior to rapid word/non-word reaction-time judgements of letter-strings. Subliminal ANGER primes delayed the time taken to reach rapid lexical decisions, relative to RELAX primes. However, individuals with high trait anger were speeded up by subliminal anger primes. ANGER primes increased systolic blood pressure and the magnitude of this increase predicted reaction time prolongation. Within the brain, ANGER trials evoked an enhancement of activity within dorsal pons and an attenuation of activity within visual occipitotemporal and attentional parietal cortices. Activity within periaqueductal grey matter, occipital and parietal regions increased linearly with evoked blood pressure changes, indicating neural substrates through which covert anger impairs semantic decisions, putatively through its expression as visceral arousal. The behavioural and physiological impact of anger states compromises the efficiency of cognitive processing through action-ready changes in autonomic response that skew regional neural activity.",0.1351297999067190,0,0.3648702000932810,0
10027037,Pituitary apoplexy after cardiac surgery presenting as deep coma with dilated pupils.,"Acute clinical deterioration due to infarction or haemorrhage of an existing, often previously unrecognized, pituitary tumour is a rare but well-described complication. It can occur spontaneously or may be caused e.g. by mechanical ventilation, infection or surgical procedures. We report on a case of pituitary apoplexy occurring in a 64-year-old patient 3 weeks after cardiac surgery. The patient presented with deep coma and dilated pupils. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a haemorrhagic pituitary tumour. After prompt endocrinologic replacement therapy with levothyroxine and hydrocortisone the patient regained consciousness. Neurological examination revealed right oculomotor nerve palsy and bilateral cranial nerve VI palsy. Subsequent trans-sphenoidal removal of a nonfunctional macroadenoma with large necrotic areas was performed. The patient recovered completely. To our knowledge, pituitary tumours presenting with a combination of deep coma and dilated pupils must be considered exceedingly rare. Possible pathophysiologic mechanisms are discussed. As our case illustrates, even in severe cases complete recovery is possible if the diagnosis is suspected, and diagnostic and therapeutic measures are initiated in time.",0.08912965945877880,0,0.4108703405412210,0

However, it is now apparent that platelets are more multifaceted than originally thought, with their function extending beyond their traditional role in hemostasis to acting as important mediators of brain function. In this review, we outline the broad repertoire of platelet function in the central nervous system, focusing on the similarities between platelets and neurons. We also summarize the role that platelets play in the pathophysiology of various neurological diseases, with a particular focus on neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Finally, we highlight the exciting prospect of harnessing the unique features of the platelet proteome and extracellular vesicles, which are rich in neurotrophic, antioxidative, and antiinflammatory factors, for the development of novel neuroprotective and neuroregenerative interventions to treat various neurodegenerative and traumatic pathologies.",0.4484107264783090,0,0.0515892735216914,0
39089142,The prevalence of complicated cervical injuries in near-hanging patients without abnormal levels of consciousness or neck signs.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical injuries are important complications of near-hanging, which is defined as self-injury by hanging if the patient survives at admission. Previous studies have reported that complicated cervical injuries due to near-hanging are uncommon. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether cervical imaging can be safely omitted for near-hanging patients who are alert and have no abnormal neck symptoms or signs. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study to investigate the prevalence of cervical injuries among hospitalized near-hanging patients between April 2014 and June 2023. The primary outcome was the prevalence of any complicated cervical injuries, which included laryngeal fractures, laryngeal deviations, spinal cord injuries, cervical spine fractures, and blunt cerebrovascular injuries. The primary aim of this study was to determine the primary outcome among near-hanging patients with normal levels of consciousness and no abnormal neck symptoms or signs. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 63 near-hanging patients were hospitalized. Of these, 11 patients (18%) with normal levels of consciousness and no neck symptoms or signs at admission were included. The median age of the patients was 37 years (IQR 27 to 53); 5 (45%) were women, and none had cardiac arrest at the scene. For the primary outcome, no complicated cervical injuries (0%; 95% CI, 0% to 27%) occurred among the small number of near-hanging patients who had normal levels of consciousness and no abnormal neck symptoms or signs at admission. CONCLUSIONS: There were no cases of complicated cervical injuries among near-hanging patients with normal levels of consciousness and no abnormal neck symptoms or signs. Further prospective multicenter studies are warranted to investigate whether cervical imaging can be safely omitted in assessments of these patients.",0.06830421419419640,0,0.4316957858058040,0

10422053,The patient's part in analytic process: the influence of the analyst's expectations.,"The psychoanalyst's expectations of the patient are complex and crucial to the work of analysis. These expectations, operating at a level generally outside the consciousness of patient and analyst, are part of the ""microstructure"" of analysis, the interactional give-and-take that brings about change. The view taken here is that analytic process is necessarily interactive, as well as intrapsychic. In addition to transference-countertransference motivations, both parties to an analysis operate in a social context that prescribes a range of desired and undesired behavior. The analyst brings to the interaction professional analytic attitudes about how to listen and act, and a set of expectations of the patient. These attitudes and expectations modulate subjective reactions to the patient's transferentially driven actions, and influence the expression of countertransference. The mutative process of psychoanalysis involves the action of these attitudes and expectations on the patient, both in ways specific to individuals and in more general ways. Such expectations lie behind analytic tactics and, though not often written of, are part of the oral tradition of psychoanalysis. Here the expected patient role is described in terms of five bipolar continua: (1) reporting and editing; (2) transferring and containing; (3) thinking about oneself and thinking about the analyst; (4) regressing and listening/self-observing; (5) initiating trial action and mediating among inner states. The activity and thinking of the dyad move constantly along these continua. A clinical example from the beginning of an hour illustrates how these expectancies emerge in analytic work.",0.3632582529663670,0,0.13674174703363300,0
17317475,Drug adverse events and drop-out risk: a clinical case.,"We report a brief discussion on a clinical case of a female patient, 85 years old, affected by severe cognitive impairment and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient was not taking drugs at home (apart from promazine: 10 drops when necessary to control her behavioral diseases). A previous neuropsychological evaluation had shown a severe cognitive impairment MMSE=16/30; ADL=3/6; IADL=0/8) due to multiple brain ischemic areas (confirmed in 2003 by MRI neuroimaging). When the patient was admitted to our center she was able to perform some basic activities of daily living such as eating and walking and was not too confused. She was included in cognitive rehabilitation groups. Since she showed signs of Parkinsonism, a therapy based on omeprazol 20mg, acetylsalicylic acid, donepezil 10mg, pramipexol 0.18 mg, nimodipine 10 drops, levodopa+carbidopa 100/25mg was started. A few days later she became sleepy during daytime and, once, she lost her balance and fell. She was not self-sufficient any more. At first this was attributed to a lung infection that the patient had, but her state continue after the infection was completely cured with appropriate antibiotics therapy. At that point an adverse drug reaction was suspected and therapy with pramipexol 0.18 mg was interrupted. In a few days the patient regained her previous level of consciousness and self-sufficiency. We consider this a typical case of complex management in a patient with dementia and comorbidity in which adverse drug reactions can play an important role in lowering the level of cognitive functions. In this case the relationship with the family of the patient was made difficult by the attitude of the patient's daughter who decided, after the onset of the adverse drug reaction, to interrupt her mother's stay in our center even at risk of the worst consequences.",0.03956572489393770,0,0.46043427510606200,0

25588680,Neural correlates of consciousness: what we know and what we have to learn!,"Consciousness is a multifaceted concept with two major components: awareness of environment and of self (i.e., the content of consciousness) and wakefulness (i.e., the level of consciousness). Medically speaking, consciousness is the state of the patient's awareness of self and environment and his responsiveness to external stimulation and inner need. A basic understanding of consciousness and its neural correlates is of major importance for all clinicians, especially those involved with patients suffering from altered states of consciousness. To this end, in this review it is shown that consciousness is dependent on the brainstem and thalamus for arousal; that basic cognition is supported by recurrent electrical activity between the cortex and the thalamus at gamma band frequencies; and that some kind of working memory must, at least fleetingly, be present for awareness to occur. New advances in neuroimaging studies are also presented in order to better understand and demonstrate the neurophysiological basis of consciousness. In particular, recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have offered the possibility to measure directly and non-invasively normal and severely brain damaged subjects' brain activity, whilst diffusion tensor imaging studies have allowed evaluating white matter integrity in normal subjects and patients with disorder of consciousness.",0.4109259607704450,0,0.08907403922955510,1
32029711,Breathing is coupled with voluntary action and the cortical readiness potential.,"Voluntary action is a fundamental element of self-consciousness. The readiness potential (RP), a slow drift of neural activity preceding self-initiated movement, has been suggested to reflect neural processes underlying the preparation of voluntary action; yet more than fifty years after its introduction, interpretation of the RP remains controversial. Based on previous research showing that internal bodily signals affect sensory processing and ongoing neural activity, we here investigated the potential role of interoceptive signals in voluntary action and the RP. We report that (1) participants initiate voluntary actions more frequently during expiration, (2) this respiration-action coupling is absent during externally triggered actions, and (3) the RP amplitude is modulated depending on the respiratory phase. Our findings demonstrate that voluntary action is coupled with the respiratory system and further suggest that the RP is associated with fluctuations of ongoing neural activity that are driven by the involuntary and cyclic motor act of breathing.",0.28719811409365200,0,0.21280188590634800,0
26748074,Using category theory to assess the relationship between consciousness and integrated information theory.,"One of the most mysterious phenomena in science is the nature of conscious experience. Due to its subjective nature, a reductionist approach is having a hard time in addressing some fundamental questions about consciousness. These questions are squarely and quantitatively tackled by a recently developed theoretical framework, called integrated information theory (IIT) of consciousness. In particular, IIT proposes that a maximally irreducible conceptual structure (MICS) is identical to conscious experience. However, there has been no principled way to assess the claimed identity. Here, we propose to apply a mathematical formalism, category theory, to assess the proposed identity and suggest that it is important to consider if there exists a proper translation between the domain of conscious experience and that of the MICS. If such translation exists, we postulate that questions in one domain can be answered in the other domain; very difficult questions in the domain of consciousness can be resolved in the domain of mathematics. We claim that it is possible to empirically test if such a functor exists, by using a combination of neuroscientific and computational approaches. Our general, principled and empirical framework allows us to assess the relationship between the domain of consciousness and the domain of mathematical structures, including those suggested by IIT.",0.3857341036525170,0,0.11426589634748300,1

This report details the presentation of a 72-year-old female who developed a fatal infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia that occurred during preoperative chemotherapy despite pegfilgrastim administration. She was brought to the hospital with symptoms of high fever and general fatigue during chemotherapy, but her respiratory symptoms were minimal, and a chest computed tomography (CT) showed no obvious signs of pneumonia. She had FN. After she was hospitalized, her breathing and consciousness worsened rapidly, and the chest CT showed prominent lobar pneumonia. Her blood cultures suggested P. aeruginosa, so she was quickly switched to meropenem. She was diagnosed with septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome due to severe P. aeruginosa pneumonia, and she was started on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation with immunoglobulin preparations. P. aeruginosa developed drug resistance, so it was necessary to change antibiotics. She was discharged without complications of pulmonary fibrosis on chest CT. It is crucial to always be aware that severe infections can occur even with pegfilgrastim administration, promptly identify the causative pathogen, and intervene with early treatment.",0.35083724842510900,0,0.14916275157489100,0

We therefore designed this study to address, first, the effect of perioperative HR on propofol dose required for LOC and, second, the effect of perioperative anxiety on HR. METHODS: Forty-five ASA physical status I-II female patients undergoing gynecological surgery were studied. Anxiety was assessed in the operating room with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-state Spielberger scale (situational anxiety). After HR recording, anesthesia was induced with a 200-mL/h 1% propofol infusion with the Base Primea pump (Fresenius-Vial, Brezins, France) until LOC. The propofol dose was recorded at the time of LOC. Relationships between STAI-state and HR versus propofol dose at LOC were tested with the Spearman test with a P value of 0.01. RESULTS: A significant relationship was observed between HR and propofol dose at LOC (rho = 0.487, P = 0.0012) but not between STAI-state and propofol dose (rho = 0.330, P = 0.0306). However, a significant relationship was observed between STAI-state and HR (rho = 0.462 and P = 0.0054). CONCLUSION: Increased perioperative HR is associated with increased propofol dose required for LOC. Perioperative anxiety accounts for increased HR.",0.03526216763235650,0,0.46473783236764400,0

30507680,Neuromonitoring in the elderly.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize recent recommendations on intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) neuromonitoring in the elderly aimed at the prevention of postoperative delirium and long-term neurocognitive decline. We discuss recent perioperative EEG investigations relating to aging and cognitive dysfunction, and their implications on intraoperative EEG neuromonitoring in elderly patients. RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly can be reduced by monitoring depth of anesthesia, using an index number (0-100) derived from processed frontal EEG readings. The recently published European Society of Anaesthesiology guideline on postoperative delirium in elderly now recommends guiding general anesthesia with such indices (Level A). However, intraoperative EEG signatures are heavily influenced by age, cognitive function, and choice of anesthetic agents. Detailed spectral EEG analysis and research on EEG-based functional connectivity provide new insights into the pathophysiology of neuronal excitability, which is seen in elderly patients with postoperative delirium. SUMMARY: Anesthesiologists should become acquainted with intraoperative EEG signatures and their relation to age, anesthetic agents, and the risk of postoperative cognitive complications. A working knowledge would allow an optimized and individualized provision of general anesthesia for the elderly.",0.08799683537385230,0,0.4120031646261480,0
16295557,"Which mild head injured patients should have follow-up after discharge from an accident and emergency ward? A study in a university hospital setting in Kelantan, Malaysia.","Mild head injury (MHI) is a common presentation to many hospitals in both rural and urban settings in Southeast Asia, but it is not well studied. We studied 330 patients that presented to Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia Emergency Department with possible MHI, with the intentions to identify prognostic factors that may improve the diagnosis of MHI in the emergency setting as well as to determine which patients would need follow-up. Patients' one-year outcomes were classified as discharged well (DW) for patients without post-traumatic signs and symptoms and discharged with long term follow-up (DFU) for patients with such signs and symptoms. Four patients died and 82 were DFU. An abnormal skull X ray was associated with mode of accident and type of transportation, older age, presence of vomiting, confusion, bleeding from ear, nose or throat, abnormal pupil size on the right side associated with orbital trauma, unequal pupillary reflexes, absence of loss of consciousness (LOC), a lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, multiple clinical presentations, and DFU. An abnormal CT scan was associated with older age, multiple clinical presentation, skull X-ray findings, and DFU. A similar analysis on outcomes revealed that mode of accident, older age, vomiting, confusion, headache, bleeding from ear, nose and throat, neurological deficits, absence of LOC, pupil size, multiple presentation, abnormal skull X ray, CT scan of the brain, and a GCS of 13 was associated with DFU. In conclusion, all patients involved in motor vehicle accidents (MVAs), especially motorcycles, aged over 30 years of age, with multiple clinical presentations, including a lower GCS, and with abnormal radiological findings should have a longer follow-up due to persistent post-traumatic symptomatology.",0.017654850496912700,0,0.4823451495030870,0
25299946,"Do cortical midline variability and low frequency fluctuations mediate William James' ""Stream of Consciousness""? ""Neurophenomenal Balance Hypothesis"" of ""Inner Time Consciousness"".","William James famously characterized consciousness by 'stream of consciousness' which describes the temporal continuity and flow of the contents of consciousness in our 'inner time consciousness'. More specifically he distinguished between ""substantive parts"", the contents of consciousness, and ""transitive parts"", the linkages between different contents. While much research has recently focused on the substantive parts, the neural mechanisms underlying the transitive parts and their characterization by the balance between 'sensible continuity' and 'continuous change' remain unclear. The aim of this paper is to develop so-called neuro-phenomenal hypothesis about specifically the transitive parts and their two phenomenal hallmark features, sensible continuity and continuous change in 'inner time consciousness'. Based on recent findings, I hypothesize that the cortical midline structures and their high degree of variability and strong low frequency fluctuations play an essential role in mediating the phenomenal balance between sensible continuity and continuous change.",0.8698903957577820,1,0.3698903957577820,1
25535970,The absoluteness of semantic processing: lessons from the analysis of temporal clusters in phonemic verbal fluency.,"BACKGROUND: For word production, we may consciously pursue semantic or phonological search strategies, but it is uncertain whether we can retrieve the different aspects of lexical information independently from each other. We therefore studied the spread of semantic information into words produced under exclusively phonemic task demands. METHODS: 42 subjects participated in a letter verbal fluency task, demanding the production of as many s-words as possible in two minutes. Based on curve fittings for the time courses of word production, output spurts (temporal clusters) considered to reflect rapid lexical retrieval based on automatic activation spread, were identified. Semantic and phonemic word relatedness within versus between these clusters was assessed by respective scores (0 meaning no relation, 4 maximum relation). RESULTS: Subjects produced 27.5 (+/-9.4) words belonging to 6.7 (+/-2.4) clusters. Both phonemically and semantically words were more related within clusters than between clusters (phon: 0.33+/-0.22 vs. 0.19+/-0.17, p<.01; sem: 0.65+/-0.29 vs. 0.37+/-0.29, p<.01). Whereas the extent of phonemic relatedness correlated with high task performance, the contrary was the case for the extent of semantic relatedness. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that semantic information spread occurs, even if the consciously pursued word search strategy is purely phonological. This, together with the negative correlation between semantic relatedness and verbal output suits the idea of a semantic default mode of lexical search, acting against rapid task performance in the given scenario of phonemic verbal fluency. The simultaneity of enhanced semantic and phonemic word relatedness within the same temporal cluster boundaries suggests an interaction between content and sound-related information whenever a new semantic field has been opened.",0.23153950667196200,0,0.2684604933280380,0
21547175,"A Comparative Study of Induction, Maintenance and Recovery Characteristics of Sevoflurane and Halothane Anaesthesia in Pediatric Patients (6 months to 6 years).","PATIENTS #ENTITYSTARTX00026; METHODS: In a randomized , double blind clinical study, we studied 30 children, aged 6 months to 6 years, to compare halothane and sevoflurane anaesthesia in patients undergoing short surgical procedures under general anaesthesia. All the patients were premedicated with atropine 0.02mg kg(-1)and midazolam 0.1mg kg(-1)body weight intravenously and received inhalation induction using nitrous oxide in oxygen supplemented with either halothane (maximum inspired concentration of 5%) or sevoflurane (maximum inspired concentration of 8%). Induction was by inhalation of increasing concentrations of sevoflurane (1%) or halothane (0.5%) in the vaporizing setting after every three breaths of the patient. RESULTS: Time to loss of eyelash reflex and tracheal intubation was more rapid using sevoflurane. Cardiac arrhythmias were significantly more frequent during halothane than sevoflurane anaesthesia. Psychomotor recovery was more rapid after sevoflurane anaesthesia. Children who received sevoflurane had comparatively less nausea and vomiting and the incidence of clinically important side effects was significantly less with sevoflurane anaesthesia. CONCLUSION: We conclude that induction with sevoflurane in nitrous oxide and oxygen leads to fast loss of consciousness and provides ideal conditions for managing the airway without supplemental opioids or muscle relaxants with haemodynamic stability and is therefore a reasonable alternative to halothane for paediatric patients.",0.32037628499294600,0,0.17962371500705400,0
40883265,"A psychoneuroimmunological underpinnings of the relationship between childhood trauma, loneliness, and depression in older adults.","Depression is highly prevalent among older people globally. It is well known that childhood trauma and loneliness are significant risk factors for depression, and neural alterations in the default mode network and immunological dysregulation (e.g., neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio) are factors significantly associated with loneliness and depression. This study examined the inter-relationships and interactions of these factors for translational insight into the pathophysiological underpinnings of late-life depression. Among ninety-two healthy older adults, we measured the leukocyte distribution as reflected by neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, childhood trauma history, current feelings of loneliness, and levels of depressive symptoms. All participants underwent structural MRI scanning to acquire T1-weighted images, which were used to measure the grey matter volume within the default mode network and its key regions. We observed that loneliness as a significant mediator explained the positive relationship between childhood emotional neglect and the severity of depression in late life. The modulating effect of grey matter volume in the default mode network depends on the level of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. In sum, our findings indicated that the more severe the lonely feeling those older people with childhood emotional neglect felt, the more the depressive symptoms were, which was especially obvious among those with relatively higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and with lower grey matter volume in the default mode network. The current findings inspire future preventive and interventional studies targeting loneliness and inflammation to promote mental wellness in older adults.",0.11415548943573300,0,0.3858445105642670,0

Clinical impairment of tension and kinesthesia.,"It is unclear whether peripheral, subcortical or intracortical loops are directly involved between receptors in muscles and tendons and the cerebral cortex in signaling movement magnitude and muscular tension information. Previous experiments have indicated that this information does reach consciousness. Data from voluntary compression of springs and strain-gauge were analyzed in patients with unilateral focal lesions of the cerebral hemispheres. It was found that the perception of signals of muscular tension is abolished by lesions of the contralateral cortex near the central sulcus. It was concluded that the possibility exists of separate cortical projection areas for kinesthetic signals from muscles and from joints.",0.10203232128515600,0,0.3979676787148440,0
22116442,Complications of endoscopic third ventriculostomy: a systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an established treatment for hydrocephalus. Most studies focus on success rates, and complications are insufficiently charted. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of ETV complications. METHODS: A Medline search discovered 24 series of ETV (seven in children, five in adults, and 12 in a mixed-age group) with detailed complications reports. RESULTS: The analysis included 2,672 ETVs performed on 2,617 patients. The cause of hydrocephalus was aqueductal stenosis in 25.9%, tumor 37.0%, meningomyelocele-Chiari II 6.1%, posthemorrhagic 5.8%, postinfectious 1.4%, cysts 3.3%, Chiari I 0.4%, Dandy-Walker malformation 0.3%, cerebellar infarct 0.9%, normal pressure hydrocephalus 1.3%, and not recorded 16.8%. Overall complication rate was 8.8%. Permanent morbidity was 2.1%, neurologic in 1.2% (hemiparesis, gaze palsy, memory disorders, and/or altered consciousness), hypothalamic in 0.9% (diabetes insipidus, weight gain, or precocious puberty). Intraoperative hemorrhage was present in 3.9%, severe in 0.6% (including four cases [0.14%] of basilar rupture). Other surgical complications were 1.13% (three thalamic infarcts, six subdural, six intracerebral, and two epidural hematomas). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infections occurred in 1.8%, CSF leak in 1.7%, anesthetic complications (bradycardia and hypotension) in 0.19% of cases. Postoperative mortality was 0.22% (six patients; sepsis two, hemorrhage three, and thalamic injury one). Another two children suffered delayed ""sudden death"" (after 25 and 60 months), caused by acute hydrocephalus due to stoma occlusion. There were no differences between pediatric and adult patients or short and long series (cutoff 100 patients). All deaths were reported in long series. Complication rates were insignificantly higher in short series. CONCLUSIONS: Permanent morbidity after ETV is 2.1%, mortality is 0.22%.

14614917,Electrical properties affecting discharge of units of the mid and posterolateral thalamus of conscious cats.,"Discharge properties in response to intracellularly applied, rectangular currents were measured in units of the mid (lateralis dorsalis and centrolateral nuclei) and posterolateral (lateralis posterior and pulvinar nuclei) thalamus of conscious cats. A separate aim was to determine if neuronal excitability changed in association with changes in stimulus-evoked activity after the animals were trained to discriminate between two acoustic stimuli when performing a conditioned motor response. Low threshold spike (l.t.s.) discharges were observed in three of 272 cells given 1 nA intracellular, hyperpolarizing current pulses of 40 ms duration. This finding supports the view that thalamic neurons of conscious animals operate mainly in the relay as opposed to the oscillatory mode. Application of larger and longer hyperpolarizing currents in the cells produced rebound l.t.s. discharges, supporting the expectation that most thalamic neurons are capable of producing this type of discharge. Decrements of spike afterhyperpolarizations (AHP) and broadening of spike bases upon repeated discharge also were observed in each area of the thalamus studied. After conditioning, changes were found in the posterolateral thalamus (but not in the mid-thalamus) in the proportions of cells with spontaneous, rapid (>/=50 Hz), repetitive, discharges (RRD) and rapid, sustained discharges at rates >/=100 Hz during application of depolarizing current (RSD). In the posterolateral thalamus the percentage of units responding to 1 nA depolarization with RSD fell from 71% before conditioning to 45% after conditioning. The percentage of cells with RRD decreased from 69% to 46%. The changes were accompanied by a 3 mV hyperpolarization of the membrane potentials of the cells and a decrease in baseline activity. After conditioning, increases in excitability were found in cells of the mid thalamus that responded selectively to the click conditioned stimulus (CS) that elicited the conditioned response, and decreases in excitability were found in cells of the posterolateral thalamus that responded to the discriminative acoustic stimulus (DS) to which the animals were trained not to respond. An earlier study showed a potentiation of discharge in response to the CS in units of the midthalamus after similar conditioning and a reduction of the proportion of DS responsive units and peak discharge to the DS in units of the posterolateral thalamus. We conclude that the discharge properties of units of the mid and posterolateral thalamus can change to support discrimination between acoustic stimuli of different functional significance after conditioning.",0.7992073911322270,1,0.29920739113222700,0

19815790,The effects of perceptual load on semantic processing under inattention.,"Inattentional blindness refers to a failure to consciously detect an irrelevant object that appears without any expectation when attention is engaged with another task. The perceptual load theory predicts that task-irrelevant stimuli will reach awareness only when the primary task is of low load, which allows processing resources to spill over to processing task-irrelevant stimuli as well. We studied whether perceptual load has an effect on inattentional blindness for a task-irrelevant stimulus whose meaning is or is not relevant to the attentional goals of the observer. In the critical trial, a word appeared without any expectation in the center of a display of attended pictures. The results showed that, under both high and low load, unexpected words belonging to the attended semantic category were detected more often than semantically unrelated words. These results imply that task-irrelevant stimuli, whose meanings are relevant to the observer's task, enter awareness irrespective of perceptual load.",0.24372448000766600,0,0.25627551999233400,0

However, determining the level of cortical activity in patients with disorders of consciousness is a real challenge. Reliable criteria are required to help clinicians in the decision-making process, especially in the acute phase of coma. In this paper, we propose recommendations for recording and interpreting electroencephalography and evoked potentials in comatose patients based on the literature and the clinical experience of a group of neurophysiologists trained in the management of comatose patients.

Following the neurosurgical intervention, deterioration of consciousness related to strong vasospasm occurred. Cerebral CT examination was performed, showing a 0.5 cm ischaemic lesion of the left hippocampal fornix. Due to intensive therapy, the patient recovered gradually, however considerable short-time memory deficit and severe anterograde amnesia remained. Admission of the patient in psychiatric care 5 weeks after the operation was necessary since acute deterioration had been added to memory disturbance and anterograde amnesia. Clinical features included severe short-time memory deficit, continuous and severe anterograde amnesia, disorientation, alterations of verbal fluency and abstraction. The amnesic syndrome was probably related to the hippocampal damage, but considering the development of cognitive deficits, cerebral CT was performed again, which verified internal hydrocephalus. A ventriculo-peritoneal shunt has been implanted and the patient was re-admitted in psychiatry care because of her memory deficit, anterograde amnesia and disorientation. Thereafter, low doses of citalopram and donepezil therapy was started together with temporarily used antipsychotic medication (risperidone).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Standardized computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPI) were conducted on a representative sample of 1000 companies employing over 50 people. RESULTS: Few companies (37%) actually know the health needs of their employees, whereas 25% admit that they care about health more than it is required by law, and declare their increased involvement in that area. At the same time, 55% of companies sponsor sports tickets, and 52% cover the costs of medical care. Every second company supports physical activity in other ways and improves the working environment. Every third offers medical prophylaxis, takes care of stress reduction and healthy eating habits, or solves the problems of alcohol consumption. The main reasons for such activities are the company's image (79%), good social atmosphere (72%) and employee's work performance (69%), while the prevention of health problems is rarely indicated (43%). The effects of workplace health promotion measures include improved productivity (50%), a better health condition (49%) and an increased identification with the company (47%). As for the obstacles, these is a shortage of financial resources (53%), the lack of favorable fiscal and legal solutions (48%), low interest among employees (45%), the lack of skilled people to manage health promotion (42%) and low awareness of its benefits (37%). Companies that are consciously involved in health promotion and monitor the actual health needs implement more activities, evaluate them more often, recognize their positive effects, and are able to better motivate their employees. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to develop systemic solutions that foster health promotion in companies, to disseminate knowledge about the benefits associated with it, and to train the staff responsible for employee health management.

In the research reported here, we combined both types of signals by surreptitiously providing participants with visual exteroceptive information about their heartbeat: A real-time video image of a periodically illuminated silhouette outlined participants' (projected, ""virtual"") bodies and flashed in synchrony with their heartbeats. We investigated whether these ""cardio-visual"" signals could modulate bodily self-consciousness and tactile perception. We report two main findings. First, synchronous cardio-visual signals increased self-identification with and self-location toward the virtual body, and second, they altered the perception of tactile stimuli applied to participants' backs so that touch was mislocalized toward the virtual body. We argue that the integration of signals from the inside and the outside of the human body is a fundamental neurobiological process underlying self-consciousness.",0.8392152078721720,1,0.3392152078721720,1

This is the first large retrospective cohort study on the primary medical and neurological complications and comorbidities in persons with DoC. A total of 146 patients admitted to a specialized inpatient DoC rehabilitation program from 1 January 2014 to 31 October 2018 were included. The incidences of those conditions since their initial brain injuries were reviewed per documentation. They were categorized into reversible causes of DoC, confounders and mimics, and other medical/neurological conditions. The common complications and comorbidities included pneumonia (73.3%), pain (75.3%), pressure ulcers (70.5%), oral and limb apraxia (67.1%), urinary tract infection (69.2%), and 4-limb spasticity (52.7%). Reversible causes of DoC occurred very commonly. Conditions that may confound the diagnosis of DoC occurred at surprisingly high rates. Conditions that may be a source of pain occurred not infrequently. Among those that may diminish or confound the level of consciousness, 4.8 +/- 2.0 conditions were identified per patient. In conclusion, high rates of various complications and comorbidities occurred in persons with DoC. Correcting reversible causes, identifying confounders and mimics, and managing general consequences need to be seriously considered in clinical practice.",0.30386020315322200,0,0.19613979684677800,0

30627464,Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome with Stroke in Puerperal Woman with High Titer of Anti-Phospholipid IgM Antibody.,"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome with stroke is very rare in puerperal women. A 36-year-old nulliparous woman with both rheumatoid arthritis and recurrent pregnancy loss, probably due to a high titer of anti-phospholipid IgM antibody, was referred at 10 weeks of gestation. Low-dose aspirin at 100 mg/day and heparin calcium subcutaneous injection at 10,000 units/day were started before pregnancy and stopped at 35(+6) and 40(+2) weeks, respectively. She transabdominally delivered a male infant weighing 3,344 g at 40(+5) weeks. A tonic-clonic seizure abruptly occurred without either hypertension or proteinuria 5 days after delivery. Intracerebral hemorrhage involving an area of 2 cm in diameter in the right frontal lobe and subarachnoid hemorrhage with PRES were confirmed. Seizure recurred 2 days after the initial episode. She showed severe headache and mild disturbance of consciousness but no neurological findings. We suggested that a high titer of anti-phospholipid IgM antibody might be associated with stroke.",0.32330287374680600,0,0.17669712625319400,0
10479027,Mismatch negativity and late auditory evoked potentials in comatose patients.,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the patterns of mismatch negativity (MMN) and N100 component in comatose patients and to evaluate their prognostic value vis-a-vis return of consciousness. METHODS: MMN and auditory (early, middle-latency and late) evoked potentials were recorded in 52 normals and in 128 comatose patients (comas due to neurosurgical and neurological problems). At the time of recording, all patients scored lower than 8 on the Glasgow scale. RESULTS: Visually detected N100 and MMN were confirmed by cross-correlation of sub-averages. The MMN was present in 33/128 patients and the N100 component in 84/128. The amplitudes of MMN and N100 waves detected in comatose patients were statistically different from those of normal subjects. By 3 months after the onset of coma, 95 patients had returned to consciousness, most of them with moderate to severe disability. A ratio of 30/33 patients with MMN and 70/84 with N100 had regained consciousness. The presence of a MMN together with a N100 component was more specific (90.9%) than the presence of a N100 component irrespective of MMN (57.6%) in terms of predicting return to consciousness, but its sensitivity was lower (respectively 31.6% for MMN and 73.7% for N100). The mean period that elapsed between the recording of evoked potentials and a return to consciousness was 6.3+/-4 days. MLAEPs were also highly specific, but BAEPs were not. CONCLUSION: MMN and auditory evoked potentials provide a reliable assessment of the functional status of comatose patients. When present, MMN and the N100 differ from those found in normal subjects in terms of latencies and amplitudes. As a predictor of return of consciousness MMN had high specificity and low sensitivity, whereas the N100 had high sensitivity and low specificity. This study demonstrates that the recording of MMN and the auditory N100 can be a very useful aid in the assessment of coma and in predicting whether or not a patient will regain consciousness.",0.09315314795461700,0,0.406846852045383,0

25764930,[Analysis on influencing factor of the complications of percutaneous dilational tracheotomy].,"OBJECTIVE: To Analyze the influence factors on the complications of percutaneous dilational tracheotomy. METHODS: Between August 2008 and February 2014, there were 3 450 patients with the indications of tracheotomy accepted percutaneous dilational tracheostomy, mainly using percutaneous dilational and percutaneous guide wire forceps in these cases. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 19.0 software on postoperative complications, the possible influence factors including age, gender, etiology, preoperative hypoxia, obesity, preoperative pulmonary infection, state of consciousness, operation method, operation doctor and whether with tracheal intubation. RESULTS: Among 3 450 patients, there were 164 cases with intraoperative or postoperative complications, including postoperative bleeding in 74 cases (2.14%), subcutaneous emphysema in 54 cases (1.57%), wound infection in 16 cases (0.46%), pneumothorax in 6 cases (0.17%), mediastinal emphysema in 5 cases (0.14%), operation failed and change to conventional incision in 4 cases (0.12%), tracheoesophageal fistula in 2 cases (0.06%), death in 3 cases(0.09%).Obesity, etiology, preoperative hypoxia, preoperative pulmonary infection, state of consciousness and operation method were the main influence factors, with significant statistical difference (chi(2) value was 0.010, 0.000, 0.002, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000, all P < 0.05). Gender, age, operation doctor and whether there was the endotracheal intubation were not the main influence factors. There was no significant statistical difference (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Although percutaneous dilational tracheostomy is safe, but the complications can also happen. In order to reduce the complications, it is need to pay attention to the factors of obesity, etiology, preoperative hypoxia, preoperative pulmonary infection, state of consciousness and operation method.",0.13739367622550100,0,0.3626063237744990,0
23274775,Neuromodulation in the service of moral enhancement.,"Human enhancement is a much debated topic in the bioethical literature. Human beings have long tried to improve their capacities and their performances through training and with the aid of tools; but more recently new means have come to the fore, such as drugs and biotechnological devices, especially in the domain of bodily strength and cognitive powers. Moral enhancement has been more seldom discussed. However, this question has recently been hotly debated between two philosophers, Thomas Douglas and John Harris. Douglas claims that modulating certain ugly emotions directly would consist in moral progress-directly, that is, without using cognitive means like persuasion or deliberation. Harris makes three objections against this thesis: such a direct neuromodulation would be inefficacious, would put our liberty in jeopardy and would lead to a moral decline. In this paper, I examine the third argument: with direct modulation, we risk intervening too much or too little, inducing an inappropriate emotion or an inappropriate level of an otherwise appropriate emotion-two upshots that will put morality in jeopardy. I conclude that the validity of this objection depends on several meta-ethical positions: if you are a rationalist or think that intentionality and consciousness are at the core of morality, you will agree with Harris, but if you are a sentimentalist or someone for whom results count, you will disagree. Here as elsewhere, ethical questions cannot be divorced from meta-ethical ones.",0.40294467240809700,0,0.09705532759190320,0
